## Custom finders

Flutter's finders are powerful, but not very intuitive to use.

We took them and made something awesome.

### Getting started

Let's you want to find some `Text` widget â€“ nothing easier than that!

```dart
find.byType(Text);
```

Using Maestro's custom finder, you'd write the above as:

```dart
$(Text);
```

Or let's find a `Text` widget with a specific text:

```dart
find.text('Subscribe');
```

Using Maestro's custom finder, you'd write the above as:

```dart
$('Subscribe');
```

Finding widgets alone is cool, but what's even cooler is being able to tap on
them! Let's tap on the first 'Subscribe' text:

```dart
await tester.tap(find.text('Subscribe').first);
```

We have to use 'first', because if there were multiple 'Subscribe' widgets, the
`tap()` throw an exception.

With Maestro, you get concise code, but you preserve the flexibility:

```dart
await $('Subscribe').tap();
```

If you wanted to tap on the third 'Subscribe' text, you'd do:

```dart
await $('Subscribe').at(2).tap();
```

### Going deeper

But hey, these were very simple examples. In real apps, unfortunately, finding
widgets is not that easy.

Often, you'll need to tap on a widget which is in some other widget.

```dart
await tester.tap(find.descendant(
  of: find.byType(ListView),
  matching: find.text('Subscribe'),
).first);
```

Flutter's finders are starting to grow, while Maestro stays lean:

```dart
$(ListView).$('Subscribe').tap();
```

If we want to also make sure that the `Subscribe` text is in a `ListTile`:

```dart
await tester.tap(
  find.descendant(
    of: find.byType(ListView),
    matching: find.descendant(
      of: find.byType(ListTile),
      matching: find.text('Subscribe'),
      ),
    ),
  ).first
);
```

Now, this is starting to look ugly. Maestro to the rescue:

```dart
await $(ListView).$(ListTile).$('Subscribe').tap();
```
