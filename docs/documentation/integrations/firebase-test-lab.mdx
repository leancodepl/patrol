title: CI - Firebase Test Lab
---

There are many device lab providers. Below we're showing how to run Patrol tests
on [Firebase Test Lab], because it's popular in the Flutter community, but the
instructions should be similar for other device farms, such as [AWS Device
Farm][aws_device_farm].

<Info>
  Before you proceed with the steps listed below, make sure that you've
  completed the [native setup] guide.

    To run the integration tests on Android, you need 2 apps: the app itself
    (often called the "app under test") and the test intrumentation app.

    To build these apps, run:

    ```
    patrol build android --target integration_test/example_test.dart
    ```

    Once you have built the apks, use the [gcloud] tool to run them on Firebase
    Test Lab:

    ```
    gcloud firebase test android run \
        --type instrumentation \
        --use-orchestrator \
        --app build/app/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk \
        --test build/app/outputs/apk/androidTest/debug/app-debug-androidTest.apk \
        --timeout 1m \
        --device model=MediumPhone.arm,version=34,locale=en,orientation=portrait \
        --record-video \
        --environment-variables clearPackageData=true
    ```

    <Info>
      You must [install the gcloud tool] first. [Here][gcloud_android] you can learn
      more about all available options and flags.
    </Info>

    <Info>
      The environment variable `clearPackageData=true` tells orchestartor to clear the
      package data between test runs. Keep in mind that it clears only the data of your
      app, not other data on the device, e.g. Chrome.
    </Info>

    It's convenient to create a shell script to avoid typing that long command
    every time. You might want to take a look at Patrol example app's
    [run_android_testlab script][example_android_script].

    <Info>
      On Android, all permissions are granted by default. This behavior can be
      changed using the [alpha version of the gcloud tool].

    To run the integration tests on iOS, you need 2 apps: the app itself
    (often called the "app under test") and the test intrumentation app.

    First, build your Flutter app, choosing the integration test file as target:

    For simulations:
    ```
    patrol build ios --target integration_test/example_test.dart --debug --simulator
    ```

    For physical devices:
    ```
    patrol build ios --target integration_test/example_test.dart --release
    ```

    `patrol build ios` outputs paths to the built app binaries, for example:

    ```
    $ patrol build ios -t integration_test/example_test.dart --release
    • Building app with entrypoint example_test.dart for iOS device (release)...
    ✓ Completed building app with entrypoint example_test.dart for iOS device (31.5s)
    build/ios_integ/Build/Products/Release-iphoneos/Runner.app (app under test)
    build/ios_integ/Build/Products/Release-iphoneos/RunnerUITests-Runner.app (test instrumentation app)
    build/ios_integ/Build/Products/Runner_iphoneos16.2-arm64.xctestrun (xctestrun file)
    ```

    Firebase Test Lab requires these files to be packaged together in a zip
    archive. To create the archive:

    ```
    pushd build/ios_integ/Build/Products
    zip -r ios_tests.zip Release-iphoneos Runner_iphoneos16.2-arm64.xctestrun
    popd
    ```

    Finally, upload the `ios_tests.zip` to Firebase Test Lab for execution:

    ```
    gcloud firebase test ios run \
      --test build/ios_integ/Build/Products/ios_tests.zip \
      --device model=iphone8,version=16.2,locale=en_US,orientation=portrait
    ```

    <Info>
      You must [install the gcloud tool] first. [Here][gcloud_ios] you can learn
      more about all available options and flags.
    </Info>

    If your `.xctestrun` file has different iOS version in its name than the
    device you're running on, simply rename the `.xctestrun` so that the version
    matches.

    It's convenient to create a shell script to avoid typing that long command
    every time. You might want to take a look at Patrol example app's
    [run_ios_testlab script][example_ios_script].
