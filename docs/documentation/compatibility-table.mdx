title: Compatibility table
---

The following table describes which versions of `patrol`
and `patrol_cli` are compatible with each other.
The simplest way to ensure that both packages are compatible
is by always using the latest version. However,
if for some reason that isn't possible, you can refer to
the table below to assess which version you should use.

This table shows the compatible versions between patrol_cli and patrol packages.

| patrol_cli version | patrol version | Minimum Flutter version |
|-------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| 3.6.0-dev.1+ | 3.16.0-dev.1+ | 3.24.0 |
| 3.5.0 - 3.5.1 | 3.14.0 - 3.15.1 | 3.24.0 |
| 3.4.1 | 3.13.1 - 3.13.2 | 3.24.0 |
| 3.4.0 | 3.13.0 | 3.24.0 |
| 3.3.0 | 3.12.0 | 3.24.0 |
| 3.2.1 | 3.11.2 | 3.24.0 |
| 3.2.0 | 3.11.0 - 3.11.1 | 3.22.0 |
| 3.1.0 - 3.1.1 | 3.10.0 | 3.22.0 |
| 2.6.5 - 3.0.1 | 3.6.0 - 3.10.0 | 3.16.0 |
| 2.6.0 - 2.6.4 | 3.4.0 - 3.5.2 | 3.16.0 |
| 2.3.0 - 2.5.0 | 3.0.0 - 3.3.0 | 3.16.0 |
| 2.2.0 - 2.2.2 | 2.3.0 - 2.3.2 | 3.3.0 |
| 2.0.1 - 2.1.5 | 2.0.1 - 2.2.5 | 3.3.0 |
| 2.0.0 | 2.0.0 | 3.3.0 |
| 1.1.4 - 1.1.11 | 1.0.9 - 1.1.11 | 3.3.0 |

## Notes

- Versions marked with `+` indicate compatibility with all later versions
- Ranges (e.g., `2.0.0 - 2.1.0`) indicate compatibility with all versions in that range
- The minimum Flutter version is required for both packages to work correctly
