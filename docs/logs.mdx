# Logs and test results

When you already wrote your tests and have them running, you need some way to know if the tests passed or need some attention. 
Patrol has 2 ways of communicating those results - logs in console and native test report.

## Logging every step

<Warning>
        This feature is available in versions `3.13.0` and later.

        If you're using this version but you don't see logs with test steps, check if you have your own `PatrolTesterConfig` passed 
        to `patrolTest()`. If yes, add `printLogs: true` argument to this constructor.
</Warning>

During the test execution, you can see that every test step, eg. `tap` or `enterText`, is printed to console, 
together with its status. Also test's name, status and time of execution is printed.

## Disabling logs

You can use following flags to configure, which logs should be printed. Pass them to `patrol test` or `patrol develop` command.

| Flag                      | Description                                | Available in                                       | Default value |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| --[no-]show-flutter-logs  | Show Flutter logs while running the tests. | `patrol test`, in `patrol develop` it's always on  | `false`       |
| --[no-]hide-test-steps    | Hide test steps while running the tests.   | `patrol test` and `patrol develop`                 | `false`       |
| --[no-]clear-test-steps   | Clear test steps after the test finishes.  | `patrol test`                                      | `true`        |

## Native report

Besides what's printed to the console, you can check the results in native report. Link to file with the report is shown in test summary, eg.
```
📊 Report: file:///Users/user/patrol/dev/e2e_app/build/app/reports/androidTests/connected/index.html
```

## Logs in `patrol_finders`

By default, if you're using `patrol_finders` without `patrol` package, enhanced logs will not be shown. If you'd like to see them, pass `printLogs: true` argument to `PatrolTesterConfig` constructor.

```
patrolWidgetTest(
  'throws exception when no widget to tap on is found',
  config: const PatrolTesterConfig(printLogs: true),
  (tester) async {
    // test body
    // ...
  },
);
```
```
testWidgets(
  'description',
  (widgetTester) async {
    final $ = PatrolTester(
      tester: widgetTester,
      config: PatrolTesterConfig(printLogs: true),
    );
    // test body
    // ...
  },
);
```
