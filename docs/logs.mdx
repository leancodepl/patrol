title: Logs and test results
---

Once you've written and executed your tests, it's essential to monitor their results. Patrol provides two main methods for reporting test outcomes: **console logs** and **native test reports**.

## Logging test steps

<Warning>
This feature is available starting from version `3.13.0`.

If you're using this version but don't see logs for test steps, check if you're passing a custom `PatrolTesterConfig` to `patrolTest()`. If so, ensure the `printLogs: true` argument is included in the constructor.
</Warning>

During test execution, every test step (e.g., `tap` or `enterText`) is logged to the console along with its status. Additionally, the test name, status, and execution time are displayed.

**Example console output:**

```

        ✅   1. scrollTo widgets with text "Open permissions screen".
        ✅   2. scrollTo widgets with text "Open permissions screen".
        ✅   3. tap widgets with text "Open permissions screen".
        ✅   4. tap widgets with text "Request camera permission".
        ✅   5. isPermissionDialogVisible (native)
        ✅   6. tap widgets with text "Request camera permission".
        ✅   7. isPermissionDialogVisible (native)
        ⏳   8. denyPermission (native)
❌ denies various permissions (integration_test/permissions/deny_many_permissions_twice_test.dart) (9s)

## Test summary

Once the tests are complete, a summary is printed:


```

## Customizing log behavior

You can customize which logs are displayed by using the following flags. These can be passed to the `patrol test` or `patrol develop` commands:

| Flag                      | Description                                | Available in                                       | Default value |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| --[no-]show-flutter-logs  | Show Flutter logs while running the tests. | `patrol test`, in `patrol develop` it's always on  | `false`       |
| --[no-]hide-test-steps    | Hide test steps while running the tests.   | `patrol test` and `patrol develop`                 | `false`       |
| --[no-]clear-test-steps   | Clear test steps after the test finishes.  | `patrol test`                                      | `true`        |

## Native test reports

In addition to console logs, you can review test results in a **native test report**. The report's file path is provided in the test summary, for example:

```
📊 Report: file:///Users/user/patrol/dev/e2e_app/build/app/reports/androidTests/connected/index.html
```

## Logs in `patrol_finders`

By default, enhanced logs are disabled when using `patrol_finders` without the `patrol` package. To enable them, pass the `printLogs: true` argument to the `PatrolTesterConfig` constructor:

```dart
patrolWidgetTest(
  'throws exception when no widget to tap on is found',
  config: const PatrolTesterConfig(printLogs: true),
  (tester) async {
    // test body
    // ...
  },
);
```
```dart
testWidgets(
  'description',
  (widgetTester) async {
    final $ = PatrolTester(
      tester: widgetTester,
      config: PatrolTesterConfig(printLogs: true),
    );
    // test body
    // ...
  },
);
```
