# Continuous integration

Having test doesn't bring you any benefits if you don't automatically verify
that they pass. We know this too well, so we've put a lot of work into making it
easy to run Patrol tests on device farm platforms like Firebase Test Lab.

## What is native instrumentation?

iOS and Android have existed for more than 15 years, and during that time a lot
of tooling was built around them.

iOS has XCUITest, and Android has UIAutomator.

Patrol tests can be run as _native instrumentation tests_ on both iOS and
Android. What does it mean and what's cool about it?

It means that many existing native testing solutions that work for iOS and
Android work with Patrol!

For example, you can run your Patrol tests directly from Xcode. Xcode knows
nothing about Flutter, Dart and Patrol ‚Äì it only launches your test app. Flutter
tests are then run inside the test app and the results are reported back to
Xcode.

Take a look at this simple Patrol test:

```dart
void main() {
  patrolTest(
    'counter state is the same after going to Home and switching apps',
    nativeAutomatorConfig: NativeAutomatorConfig(
      packageName: 'pl.leancode.patrol.example',
      bundleId: 'pl.leancode.patrol.Example',
    ),
    nativeAutomation: true,
    ($) async {
      await $.pumpWidget(ExampleApp());

      await $(FloatingActionButton).tap();
      expect($(#counterText).text, '1');

      await $.native.pressHome();
      await $.native.openApp();

      expect($(#counterText).text, '1');

      await $(FloatingActionButton).tap();
      expect($(#counterText).text, '2');
    },
  );
}
```

You can run this test and view the results in all sorts of different tools and
IDEs:

    { label: "Android Studio", value: "studio" },
    { label: "Xcode", value: "xcode" },

    { label: "Gradle", value: "gradle" },
    { label: "fastlane scan", value: "xcpretty" },
  ]}

    When Android test finishes, its test results are automatically generated in
    `build/app/outputs/androidTest-results/connected/test-result.pb`. To view
    them in Android Studio, use the `Run > Import tests from file` option.

    You don't have to use the bulky Android Studio to view your test results,
    because Gradle üêò automatically generate a nice HTML summary!

    You can find it in `build/app/reports/androidTests/connected/index.html`.

    With the help of awesome [fastlane scan] you can prettify the output of
    `xcodebuild` to make it easier to understand and generate HTML summary of
    your tests.

This is so awesome!

## Setup

Android is a bit easier to set up, so we recommend starting with it!

<Tabs 
  defaultValue="android" 
  values={[
    { label: "Android", value: "android" },
    { label: "iOS", value: "ios" },
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="android">
    
      Create an instrumentation test file in your application's
      **android/app/src/androidTest/java/com/example/myapp/** directory (replacing
      com, example, and myapp with values from your app's package name). You can name
      this test file `MainActivityTest.java` or another name of your choice.

      ```java
      package pl.leancode.patrol.example; // replace with your app's package

      import dev.flutter.plugins.integration_test.FlutterTestRunner;
      import org.junit.Rule;
      import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
      import pl.leancode.patrol.PatrolTestRule;

      @RunWith(FlutterTestRunner.class)
      public class MainActivityTest {
          @Rule
          public PatrolTestRule<MainActivity> rule = new PatrolTestRule<>(MainActivity.class);
      }
      ```

      Next, update your **app-level build.gradle**:

      ```groovy
      android {
        // ...
        defaultConfig {
          //...
          testInstrumentationRunner "androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"
        }
      }

      dependencies {
          testImplementation "junit:junit:4.13.2"
      }
      ```

      To run `integration_test/example_test.dart` on a local Android device (emulated or
      physical):

      ```bash
      $ ./gradlew app:connectedDebugAndroidTest -Ptarget=$(pwd)/../integration_test/example_test.dart
      ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ios">

    Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode. Create a test target if you
    do not already have one via `File > New > Target...` and select `UI Testing Bundle`.
    Change the `Product Name` to `RunnerUITests`. Make sure `Target to be Tested` is set to `Runner` and language is set to `Objective-C`.
    Select `Finish`.
    Make sure that the **iOS Deployment Target** of `RunnerTests` within the **Build Settings** section is the same as `Runner`.

    Add the new test target to `ios/Podfile` by embedding in the existing `Runner` target.

    ```ruby
    target 'Runner' do
      # Do not change existing lines.
      ...

      target 'RunnerUITests' do
        inherit! :complete
      end
    end
    ```

    To build `integration_test/example_test.dart` from the command line, run:

    ```bash
    $ flutter build ios --config-only integration_test/example_test.dart
    ```

    In Xcode, add a test file called `RunnerTests.m` (or any name of your choice) to the new target and
    replace the file:

    ```objective-c
    @import XCTest;
    @import integration_test;

    PATROL_INTEGRATION_TEST_IOS_RUNNER(RunnerTests)
    ```

    To run the test on a local iOS device (simulated or physical):
    - run `Product > Test` to run the integration tests on your selected device.
    - or click the "play" button on the last line of your test:

## Run on Firebase Test Lab

There are many device lab providers. Below we're showing how to run Patrol tests
on [Firebase Test Lab], because it's popular in the Flutter community, but the
instructions should be similar for other device farms, such as [AWS Device
Farm][aws_device_farm] or [BrowserStack][browserstack].
