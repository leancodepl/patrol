# Continuous integration

Having tests doesn't bring you any benefits if you don't automatically verify
that they pass. We know this too well, so we've put a lot of work into making it
easy to run Patrol tests in a multitude of ways, so you can choose whatever
suits you best.

  Before you proceed with the steps listed below, make sure that you've
  completed the [native setup] guide.

### Run on Firebase Test Lab

There are many device lab providers. Below we're showing how to run Patrol tests
on [Firebase Test Lab], because it's popular in the Flutter community, but the
instructions should be similar for other device farms, such as [AWS Device
Farm][aws_device_farm] or [BrowserStack][browserstack].

    To run the integration tests on Android, you need 2 apps:

    - the normal apk (often called the "app under test"). To build it, run:

      ```
      ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug -Ptarget="$(pwd)/../integration_test/example_test.dart"
      ```

    - the intrumentation apk. To build it, run:

      ```
      ./gradlew :app:assembleDebugAndroidTest
      ```

    You need to run the above commands from the `android` directory of your
    Flutter project.

    Once you have built the apks, use the [gcloud] tool to run them on Firebase
    Test Lab:

    ```
    gcloud firebase test android run --type instrumentation \
        --app build/app/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk \
        --test build/app/outputs/apk/androidTest/debug/app-debug-androidTest.apk \
        --timeout 1m \
        --results-bucket=<RESULTS_BUCKET> \
        --results-dir=<RESULTS_DIRECTORY>
    ```

    It can be convenient to write a utility shell script to automate this process
    instead of having to enter these long commands every time you want to run
    tests. In such case, you might want to take a look at Patrol example app's
    [run_android_testlab script][example_android_script].

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ios">

    First, build your Flutter app, choosing the integration test file as target:

    ```
    flutter build ios --target integration_test/example_test.dart --debug # or --release
    ```

    Then, build the UI testing target by running `xcodebuild` in the `ios`
    directory:

    ```
    xcodebuild build-for-testing \
      -workspace Runner.xcworkspace \
      -scheme Runner \
      -xcconfig Flutter/Release.xcconfig \
      -configuration Release \
      -derivedDataPath ../build/ios_integ \
      -sdk iphoneos \
      OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS='$(inherited) -D PATROL_ENABLED'
    ```

    If you want to test a debug version of your app, replace `xcconfig` and
    `configuration`:

    ```
    xcodebuild build-for-testing \
      -workspace Runner.xcworkspace \
      -scheme Runner \
      -xcconfig Flutter/Debug.xcconfig \
      -configuration Debug \
      -derivedDataPath ../build/ios_integ \
      -sdk iphoneos \
      OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS='$(inherited) -D PATROL_ENABLED'
    ```

    Now, go to your project's root directory, and from there go to the build
    outputs:

    ```
    cd build/ios_integ/Build/Products
    ```

    Create a zip archive named `ios_test.zip`. It will contain both your app
    under test (`Runner` target) and UI test runner (`RunnerUITests` target).

    ```
    zip -r "ios_tests.zip" "Release-iphoneos" "Runner_iphoneos15.7-arm64.xctestrun"
    ```

    And finally, upload the `ios_test.zip` to Firebase Test Lab for execution:


    ```
    exec gcloud firebase test ios run \
      --test "build/ios_integ/Build/Products/ios_tests.zip" \
      --device model=iphone8,version=15.7,locale=en_US,orientation=portrait
    ```

    If your `.xctestrun` file has different iOS version in its name than the
    device you're running on, simply rename the `.xctestrun` so that the version
    will match.

    It can be convenient to write a utility shell script to automate this process
    instead of having to enter these long commands every time you want to run
    tests. In such case, you might want to take a look at Patrol example app's
    [run_ios_testlab script][example_ios_script].
