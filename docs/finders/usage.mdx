# Usage

This page introduces Patrol's custom finder system. Let's get our hands dirty
and find some widgets!

### Just finders

Let's say you want to find some `Text` widget – nothing easier than that!

```dart
find.byType(Text);
```

Using Patrol's custom finder, you'd write the above as:

```dart
$(Text);
```

Or let's find a `Text` widget with a specific text:

```dart
find.text('Subscribe');
```

Using Patrol's custom finder, you'd write the above as:

```dart
$('Subscribe');
```

Worth mentioning is also `Key`. The below lines are equivalent:

```dart
find.byKey(Key('loginButton'));
$(Key('loginButton'));
$(#loginButton);
```

For those wondering what is that `#` thing – it's a
[Symbol](https://api.dart.dev/dart-core/Symbol-class.html)! Yes, we're Dart
(ab)users.

All the types that you can pass to `$` are [listed in the documentation][doc].

### Making assertions

Creating a finder doesn't do anything – it just _is_. Let's put them to use and
write a few simple assertions.

Here's how you can make sure that a widget with text `Log in` exists in the
widget tree:

```dart
expect(find.text('Log in'), findsOneWidget);
```

With our custom finders, you'd write the above as:

```dart
expect($('Log in'), findsOneWidget);
```

Alternatively, you could also use the `exists` getter, which returns true if the
finder finds at least 1 widget:

```dart
expect($('Log in').exists, equals(true));
```

We can also make sure that no widget exists, or that a particular number of
widgets exist:

```dart
expect(find.text("Can't touch this"), findsNothing);
expect(find.byType(Card), findsNWidgets(3));
```

The above expressed with Patrol's custom finders:

```dart
expect($("Can't touch this"), findsNothing);
expect($(Card), findsNWidgets(3));
```

You could alternatively write the first line as:

```dart
expect($("Can't touch this").exists, equals(false));
```

It's important to note that Flutter's default finder functions, such as
[findsNothing] and [findsOneWidget], check if the widget is present in the
widget tree, not if it is visible to the user, which is usually not what we're
interested in.

To check if the finder finds at least 1 _visible_ widget, use the `visible`
getter:

```dart
expect($('Log in').visible, equals(true));
```

And to wait for at least 1 widget with the "Log in" text to become visible:

```dart
await $('Log in').waitUntilVisible();
```

### Performing actions

Finding widgets alone is cool, but what's even cooler is being able to tap on
them! Let's tap on the first "Subscribe" text:

```dart
await tester.tap(find.text('Subscribe').first);
```

It's usually a good practice to use `first`, because if there were multiple
"Subscribe" texts, `tap()` would throw an exception.

With Patrol, you get concise code, but you preserve the flexibility:

```dart
await $('Subscribe').tap();
```

What's very cool about Patrol's `tap()` is that it doesn't immediately fail if
the finder finds no visible widgets – instead, it waits for some time (which you
can specify globally in [PatrolTesterConfig] or as argument to the `tap()`
method) and taps on the first widget as soon as it becomes visible. This lets
you get rid of fixed timeouts and test your app just like a real user would.

If you wanted to tap on the third "Subscribe" text, you'd do:

```dart
await $('Subscribe').at(2).tap();
```

And if the "Subscribe" text was in a [Scrollable] widget, such as
[SingleChildScrollView] or [ListView], and you want to make sure that it is
visible (so you can `tap()` on it), you can scroll to it very easily:

```dart
await $('Subscribe').scrollTo().tap();
```

### Waiting for widgets

Mobile apps often can't show content immediately - it first has to be
fetched from the server, which takes some time. This requires you to write tests
that don't fail as soon as some action is performed on a widget is not visible,
but rather wait for a short time in hope that the widget will, eventually,
become visible.

Fortunately, Patrol's [tap()] and [enterText()] methods have this behavior
built-in:

```dart
await $('Search user').enterText('Charlie Root');
await $('Show user profile').tap();
await $('Follow').tap();
```

In a typical app, each action in the test above would show a loading screen for
a short while until the data would be loaded.

Sometimes though, you might want to assert that a certain widget is visible, but
take no further action. To accomplish this, use Patrol's [waitUntilVisible()]
method (it's used by `tap()` and `enterText()` under the hood):

```dart
await $('Your profile').waitUntilVisible();
await $('Log out').tap();
```

<Warning>
  Patrol's `waitUntilVisible()` assumes that a widget is visible when it can
  perform a hit test on it using Flutter's [hitTestable()] method.
</Warning>

This means that:

- `waitUntilVisible()` will not work if the widget (whose visibility you want to
  assert) is a descendant of [IgnorePointer] widget. Consider using
  [AbsorbPointer] instead.
- since `waitUntilVisible()` is used by other methods, such as `tap()`,
  `enterText()`, and `scrollTo()` under the hood, the same restrictions apply to
  them.

### Going deeper

But hey, these were very simple examples. In real apps, unfortunately, finding
widgets is not that easy.

Often, you'll need to tap on a widget which is in some other widget.

```dart
await tester.tap(
  find.descendant(
    of: find.byType(ListView),
    matching: find.text('Subscribe'),
  ).first
);
```

Flutter's finders are starting to grow, while Patrol stays lean:

```dart
await $(ListView).$('Subscribe').tap();
```

Now, we also make sure that the `Subscribe` text is in a `ListTile`:

```dart
await tester.tap(
  find.descendant(
    of: find.byType(ListView),
    matching: find.descendant(
      of: find.byType(ListTile),
      matching: find.text('Subscribe'),
      ),
    ),
  ).first
);
```

Hey, this is starting to look complex! Fortunately, you have Patrol:

```dart
await $(ListView).$(ListTile).$('Subscribe').tap();
```

Sometimes, you might want to perform a lookahead check. Let's say that you want
tap on the first widget with the `Key('learnMore')` that is a descendant of some
`ListTile`, but that `ListTile` must also have the `Text` descendant with the
`Activated` text.

If you were to express the above as a `Finder`, you'd get:

```dart
await tester.tap(
  find.ancestor(
    of: find.text('Activated'),
    matching: find.descendant(
      of: find.byType(ListTile),
      matching: find.byKey(Key('learnMore')),
    ),
  ).first
);
```

With the help of Patrol's custom finders, it's much easier:

```dart
await $(ListTile).containing('Activated').$(#learnMore).tap();
```

### Falling back

What's cool about Patrol is that it builds on top of `flutter_test` instead of
replacing it. This means that you can freely mix Patrol's finders with finders
from `flutter_test`, `PatrolTester` with `WidgetTester`, and so on.

Here's how you can access the default `WidgetTester`:

```dart
patrolTest('adds comment', (PatrolTester $) async {
  final WidgetTester tester = $.tester;

  await tester.enterText(find.byKey(Key('commentTextField')), 'Very nice!');
});
