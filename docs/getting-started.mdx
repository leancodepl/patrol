# Getting started

Patrol consists of 2 packages:

- [patrol] – the core package
- [patrol_cli] - the CLI app which enables the [native automation feature].

### Install

First, add the `patrol` package as a `dev_dependency` in your app's
`pubspec.yaml`. You can do this by executing the following command in the app's
directory:

```console
flutter pub add patrol --dev
```

### Use

To use [patrol] in your test files, first import it:

```dart
import 'package:patrol/patrol.dart';
```

Once imported, you can write widget tests:

```dart title="test/widget_test.dart"
void main() {
  patrolTest(
    'counter is incremented when plus button is tapped',
    (PatrolTester $) async {
      await $.pumpWidget(const MyApp());

      expect($('0'), findsOneWidget);
      expect($('-1'), findsNothing);

      await $(Icons.remove).tap();

      expect($('0'), findsNothing);
      expect($('-1'), findsOneWidget);
    },
  );
}
```

To run the test, simply execute:

```console
flutter test
```

Below is the same test written using vanilla Flutter:

```dart title="test/vanilla_widget_test.dart"
void main() {
  testWidgets(
    'counter is incremented when plus button is tapped',
    (WidgetTester tester) async {
      await tester.pumpWidget(const MyApp());

      expect(find.text('0'), findsOneWidget);
      expect(find.text('-1'), findsNothing);

      await tester.tap(find.byIcon(Icons.remove));
      await tester.pump();

      expect(find.text('0'), findsNothing);
      expect(find.text('-1'), findsOneWidget);
    },
  );
}
```

This is just a small demo: Patrol's got many more features that make writing
tests easier and more fun.

<Info>
  There are 2 types of tests specific to Flutter: widget tests (living in the
  `test` directory) and integration tests (living in the `integration_test`
  directory). Use `flutter test` to run widget tests. To run integration tests
  using Patrol's [native automation feature], use `patrol test` instead. Read on
  to learn more!
</Info>

### Going from here

Patrol has 2 main features that can be used independently of each other:
**custom finders** and **native capabilities**. The choice if to use one or both
belongs to you (yet most people use both!)

[Here][custom_finders] you can learn more about custom finders. They make
interacting with Flutter widgets in tests much easier and more concise – you've
seen the tiny sample above! They are platform independent and work in widget
tests and integration tests.

[Here][native automation feature] you can learn more about our native
automation. Native automation lets you do things that were previously impossible
in Flutter integration tests - for example, you can go to the home screen, tap
on notifications, change device settings, or toggle Wi-Fi.
