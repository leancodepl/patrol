## Getting started

Patrol has 2 main features that can be used independently of each other:
**custom finders** and **native capabilities**. The choice if to use one or both
belongs to you.

[Here][custom_finders] you can learn more about custom finders, and
[here][native_capabilities] you can learn more about native capabilities.

[custom_finders]: /custom-finders/overview
[native_capabilities]: /native/overview
