# Getting started

<Warning>
        In this tutorial, we are using example app, which has package name
        `com.example.myapp` on Android, bundle id `com.example.MyApp` on iOS
        and `My App` name on both Android and iOS. Replace any occurences
        of those names with proper values.
</Warning>

### Add dependency on patrol

If you haven't already, add a dependency on the `patrol` package in the
`dev_dependencies` section of **pubspec.yaml**.

```
flutter pub add patrol --dev
```

### Configure Patrol in pubspec.yaml

Create `patrol` section in your **pubspec.yaml**:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  # ...

dev_dependencies:
  # ...

patrol:
  app_name: My App
  android:
    package_name: com.example.myapp
  ios:
    bundle_id: com.example.MyApp
```

### Install patrol_cli

Patrol CLI (command-line interface) is a small program that enables running
Patrol UI tests. It is necessary to run UI tests (`flutter test` won't work!).

1. Install `patrol_cli` executable:

   ```
   dart pub global activate patrol_cli
   ```

2. Verify that installation was successful and your enviroment is set up properly:

   ```
   patrol doctor
   ```

### Integrate with native side

The 3 first steps were common across platforms. The rest is platform-specific.

Psst... Android is a bit easier to set up, so we recommend starting with it!

#### Android setup

      1. Go to **android/app/src/androidTest/java/com/example/myapp/** in your project
         directory. If there are no such folders, create them.

      2. Create a file named `MainActivityTest.java` and copy there the code below.

      ```java title="MainActivityTest.java"
      package com.example.myapp; // replace "com.example.myapp" with your app's package

      import androidx.test.platform.app.InstrumentationRegistry;
      import org.junit.Test;
      import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
      import org.junit.runners.Parameterized;
      import org.junit.runners.Parameterized.Parameters;
      import pl.leancode.patrol.PatrolJUnitRunner;

      @RunWith(Parameterized.class)
      public class MainActivityTest {
          @Parameters(name = "{0}")
          public static Object[] testCases() {
              PatrolJUnitRunner instrumentation = (PatrolJUnitRunner) InstrumentationRegistry.getInstrumentation();
              instrumentation.setUp(MainActivity.class);
              instrumentation.waitForPatrolAppService();
              return instrumentation.listDartTests();
          }

          public MainActivityTest(String dartTestName) {
              this.dartTestName = dartTestName;
          }

          private final String dartTestName;

          @Test
          public void runDartTest() {
              PatrolJUnitRunner instrumentation = (PatrolJUnitRunner) InstrumentationRegistry.getInstrumentation();
              instrumentation.runDartTest(dartTestName);
          }
      }
      ```

      3. Go to the **build.gradle** file, located in **android/app** folder in your
         project directory.

      4. Add these 2 lines to the `defaultConfig` section:

      ```groovy
        testInstrumentationRunner "pl.leancode.patrol.PatrolJUnitRunner"
        testInstrumentationRunnerArguments clearPackageData: "true"
      ```

      5. Add this section to the `android` section:

      ```groovy
        testOptions {
          execution "ANDROIDX_TEST_ORCHESTRATOR"
        }
      ```

      6. Add this line to `dependencies` section:

      ```groovy
        androidTestUtil "androidx.test:orchestrator:1.4.2"
      ```

#### iOS setup

      1. Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode. 
      
      2. Create a test target if you do not already have one via `File > New > Target...`
         and select `UI Testing Bundle`. Change the `Product Name` to `RunnerUITests`. Make
         sure `Target to be Tested` is set to `Runner` and language is set to `Objective-C`.
         Select `Finish`.

      3. 2 files are created: `RunnerUITests.m` and `RunnerUITestsLaunchTests.m`.
         Delete `RunnerUITestsLaunchTests.m` **through Xcode**.

      4. Make sure that the **iOS Deployment Target** of `RunnerUITests` within the
         **Build Settings** section is the same as `Runner`.
         The minimum supported **iOS Deployment Target** is `13.0`.

      ![Xcode iOS deployment target](/assets/ios_deployment_target.png)

      ![Xcode iOS deployment target 2](/assets/ios_deployment_target_2.png)

      5. Replace contents of `RunnerUITests.m` file with the following:

      ```objective-c title="ios/RunnerUITests/RunnerUITests.m"
      @import XCTest;
      @import patrol;
      @import ObjectiveC.runtime;

      PATROL_INTEGRATION_TEST_IOS_RUNNER(RunnerUITests)
      ```

      Add the newly created target to `ios/Podfile` by embedding in the existing
      `Runner` target.

      ```ruby title="ios/Podfile"
      target 'Runner' do
        # Do not change existing lines.
        ...

        target 'RunnerUITests' do
          inherit! :complete
        end
      end
      ```

      6. Create an empty file `integration_test/example_test.dart`. From the command line, run:

      ```
      $ flutter build ios --config-only integration_test/example_test.dart
      ```

      7. Go to your `ios` directory and run:

      ```
      $ pod install --repo-update
      ```

      8. Open your Xcode project and make sure every target has correct base
         Build Configurations:

      ```
      $ open Runner.xcworkspace
      ```

      ![Xcode config setup](/assets/ios_runner_configs.png)

      9. Add 2 new "Run Script Phase" Build Phases to the RunnerUITests target:

      ![Xcode config setup](/assets/ios_runner_build_phases.png)

      10. Paste this code into the first `xcode_backend build` Build Phase:

      ```
      /bin/sh "$FLUTTER_ROOT/packages/flutter_tools/bin/xcode_backend.sh" build
      ```

      11. Paste this code into the second `xcode_backend embed_and_thin` Build Phase:

      ```
      /bin/sh "$FLUTTER_ROOT/packages/flutter_tools/bin/xcode_backend.sh" embed_and_thin
      ```

      12. Xcode by default also enables a "parallel execution" setting, which
         breaks Patrol. Disable it:

### Create a simple integration test

Let's create a dummy Flutter integration test that you'll use to verify
that Patrol is correctly set up.

Paste the following code into `integration_test/example_test.dart`:

```dart title="integration_test/example_test.dart"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:patrol/patrol.dart';

void main() {
  patrolTest(
    'counter state is the same after going to home and switching apps',
    nativeAutomation: true,
    ($) async {
      // Replace later with your app's main widget
      await $.pumpWidgetAndSettle(
        MaterialApp(
          home: Scaffold(
            appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('app')),
            backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
          ),
        ),
      );

      expect($('app'), findsOneWidget);
      await $.native.pressHome();
    },
  );
}
```

It does only 2 things:

- first, it finds a text `app`
- then, it then exits to home screen

It's a very simple test, but it's enough to verify that Patrol is correctly set
up. To run `integration_test/example_test.dart` on a local Android or iOS device
      (emulated or physical):

      ```
      patrol test -t integration_test/example_test.dart
      ```

      If the setup is successful, you should see a **TEST PASSED** message.

      <Info>
        If your app is using flavors, then you can pass them like so:

        ```
        patrol test --target integration_test/example_test.dart --flavor development
        ```

        or you can specify them in **pubspec.yaml** (recommended):

        ```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
        patrol:
          app_name: My App
          flavor: development
          android:
            package_name: com.example.myapp
          ios:
            bundle_id: com.example.MyApp
            app_name: The Awesome App
        ```
      </Info>
