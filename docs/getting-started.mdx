# Getting started

Patrol consists of 2 packages:

- [patrol] – the core package
- [patrol_cli] - the CLI app which enables [the native automation
  feature][native_capabilities]

## Install

First, add the `patrol` package as a `dev_dependency` in your app's
`pubspec.yaml`. You can do this by executing the following command in the app's
directory:

```console
flutter pub add patrol --dev
```

## Use

To use [patrol] in your test files, first import it:

```dart
import 'package:patrol/patrol.dart';
```

Once imported, you can write widget tests:

```dart
void main() {
  patrolTest(
    'counter is incremented when plus button is tapped',
    (PatrolTester $) async {
      await $.pumpWidget(const MyApp());

      expect($('0'), findsOneWidget);
      expect($('-1'), findsNothing);

      await $(Icons.remove).tap();

      expect($('0'), findsNothing);
      expect($('-1'), findsOneWidget);
    },
  );
}
```

To run the test, simply execute:

```console
flutter test
```

Below is the same test written using vanilla Flutter:

```dart
void main() {
  testWidgets(
    'counter is incremented when plus button is tapped',
    (WidgetTester tester) async {
      await tester.pumpWidget(const MyApp());

      expect(find.text('0'), findsOneWidget);
      expect(find.text('-1'), findsNothing);

      await tester.tap(find.byIcon(Icons.remove));
      await tester.pump();

      expect(find.text('0'), findsNothing);
      expect(find.text('-1'), findsOneWidget);
    },
  );
}
```

This just a small demo: Patrol's got many more features that make writing tests
easier and more fun.

## Going from here

Patrol has 2 main features that can be used independently of each other:
**custom finders** and **native capabilities**. The choice if to use one or both
belongs to you (yet most people use both!)

[Here][custom_finders] you can learn more about custom finders. They make
interacting with Flutter widgets in tests much easier and more concise – you've
seen the tiny sample above! They are platform independent and work in widget
tests and integration tests.

[Here][native_capabilities] you can learn more about our native automation.
Native automation lets you do things that were previously impossible in Flutter
integration tests - for e
