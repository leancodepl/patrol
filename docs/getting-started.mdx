# Getting started

Check out our video version of this tutorial on YouTube!

<YouTube id="zwQB8LfnTN8" />

<Info>
     If you want to use Patrol finders in your existing widget or golden
     tests, go to [Using Patrol finders in widget tests].
</Info>

<Warning>
        In this tutorial, we are using example app, which has package name
        `com.example.myapp` on Android, bundle id `com.example.MyApp` on iOS,
        `com.example.macos.MyApp` on macOS and `My App` name on all platforms.
        Replace any occurences of those names with proper values.
</Warning>

<Warning>
        Support for macOS is in alpha stage. Please be aware that some features
        may not work as expected. There is also no native automation support
        for macOS yet. If you encounter any issues, please report them on
        GitHub.
</Warning>

### Add dependency on `patrol`

If you haven't already, add a dependency on the `patrol` package in the
`dev_dependencies` section of `pubspec.yaml`.  `patrol` package requires
Android SDK version 21 or higher.

```
flutter pub add patrol --dev
```

### Configure Patrol in `pubspec.yaml`

Create `patrol` section in your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  # ...

dev_dependencies:
  # ...

patrol:
  app_name: My App
  android:
    package_name: com.example.myapp
  ios:
    bundle_id: com.example.MyApp
  macos:
    bundle_id: com.example.macos.MyApp
```

If you don't know where to get `package_name` and `bundle_id` from, see the [FAQ] section.

### Install `patrol_cli`

[Patrol CLI] (command-line interface) is a small program that enables running
Patrol UI tests. It is necessary to run UI tests (`flutter test` won't work! [Here's why]).

1. Install `patrol_cli` executable:

   ```
   dart pub global activate patrol_cli
   ```

  <Info>
     Make sure to add `patrol` to your `PATH` environment variable.
     It's explained how to do it in the [README](https://pub.dev/packages/patrol_cli#installation).
  </Info>

2. Verify that installation was successful and your environment is set up properly:

   ```
   patrol doctor
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   Patrol CLI version: 2.3.1+1
   Android:
   • Program adb found in /Users/username/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb
   • Env var $ANDROID_HOME set to /Users/username/Library/Android/sdk
   iOS / macOS:
   • Program xcodebuild found in /usr/bin/xcodebuild
   • Program ideviceinstaller found in /opt/homebrew/bin/ideviceinstaller
   ```
   Be sure that for the platform you want to run the test on, all the checks are green.

Patrol CLI invokes the Flutter CLI for certain commands. To override the command used,
pass the `--flutter-command` argument or set the `PATROL_FLUTTER_COMMAND` environment
variable. This supports FVM (by setting the value to `fvm flutter`), puro (`puro flutter`)
and potentially other version managers.

### Integrate with native side

The 3 first steps were common across platforms. The rest is platform-specific.

Psst... Android is a bit easier to set up, so we recommend starting with it!

<Accordion defaultOpen title="Android setup">

      1. Go to **android/app/src/androidTest/java/com/example/myapp/** in your project
         directory. If there are no such folders, create them. **Remember to replace
         `/com/example/myapp/` with the path created by your app's package name.**

      2. Create a file named `MainActivityTest.java` and copy there the code below.

      ```java title="MainActivityTest.java"
      package com.example.myapp; // replace "com.example.myapp" with your app's package

      import androidx.test.platform.app.InstrumentationRegistry;
      import org.junit.Test;
      import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
      import org.junit.runners.Parameterized;
      import org.junit.runners.Parameterized.Parameters;
      import pl.leancode.patrol.PatrolJUnitRunner;

      @RunWith(Parameterized.class)
      public class MainActivityTest {
          @Parameters(name = "{0}")
          public static Object[] testCases() {
              PatrolJUnitRunner instrumentation = (PatrolJUnitRunner) InstrumentationRegistry.getInstrumentation();
              // replace "MainActivity.class" with "io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivity.class" 
              // if your AndroidManifest is using: android:name="io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivity"
              instrumentation.setUp(MainActivity.class);
              instrumentation.waitForPatrolAppService();
              return instrumentation.listDartTests();
          }

          public MainActivityTest(String dartTestName) {
              this.dartTestName = dartTestName;
          }

          private final String dartTestName;

          @Test
          public void runDartTest() {
              PatrolJUnitRunner instrumentation = (PatrolJUnitRunner) InstrumentationRegistry.getInstrumentation();
              instrumentation.runDartTest(dartTestName);
          }
      }
      ```

      3. Go to the **build.gradle** file, located in **android/app** folder in your
         project directory.

      4. Add these 2 lines to the `defaultConfig` section:

      ```groovy
        testInstrumentationRunner "pl.leancode.patrol.PatrolJUnitRunner"
        testInstrumentationRunnerArguments clearPackageData: "true"
      ```

      5. Add this section to the `android` section:

      ```groovy
        testOptions {
          execution "ANDROIDX_TEST_ORCHESTRATOR"
        }
      ```

      6. Add this line to `dependencies` section:

      ```groovy
        androidTestUtil "androidx.test:orchestrator:1.4.2"
      ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion defaultOpen title="iOS setup">

      1. Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode. 
      
      2. Create a test target if you do not already have one (see the screenshot below
         for the reference). Select `File > New > Target...` and select `UI Testing Bundle`.
         Change the `Product Name` to `RunnerUITests`. Set the `Organization Identifier`
         to be the same as for the `Runner` (no matter if you app has flavors or not).
         For our example app, it's `com.example.MyApp` just as in the `pubspec.yaml` file.
         Make sure `Target to be Tested` is set to `Runner` and language is set to `Objective-C`.
         Select `Finish`.

      ![Xcode iOS test target](/assets/ios_test_target.png)

      3. 2 files are created: `RunnerUITests.m` and `RunnerUITestsLaunchTests.m`.
         Delete `RunnerUITestsLaunchTests.m` **through Xcode** by clicking on it and
         selecting `Move to Trash`.

      4. Make sure that the **iOS Deployment Target** of `RunnerUITests` within the
         **Build Settings** section is the same as `Runner`.
         The minimum supported **iOS Deployment Target** is `11.0`. For the
         [example app](https://github.com/leancodepl/patrol/tree/master/packages/patrol/example),
         we set it to `13.0` because it's required by the app dependencies.

      ![Xcode iOS deployment target](/assets/ios_deployment_target.png)

      ![Xcode iOS deployment target 2](/assets/ios_deployment_target_2.png)

      5. Replace contents of `RunnerUITests.m` file with the following:

      ```objective-c title="ios/RunnerUITests/RunnerUITests.m"
      @import XCTest;
      @import patrol;
      @import ObjectiveC.runtime;

      PATROL_INTEGRATION_TEST_IOS_RUNNER(RunnerUITests)
      ```

      Add the newly created target to `ios/Podfile` by embedding in the existing
      `Runner` target.

      ```ruby title="ios/Podfile"
      target 'Runner' do
        # Do not change existing lines.
        ...

        target 'RunnerUITests' do
          inherit! :complete
        end
      end
      ```

      6. Create an empty file `integration_test/example_test.dart` in the root of your Flutter project. From the command line, run
         the following command and make sure it completes with no errors:

      ```
      $ flutter build ios --config-only integration_test/example_test.dart
      ```

      7. Go to your `ios` directory and run:

      ```
      $ pod install --repo-update
      ```

      8. Open your Xcode project and Make sure that for each build configuration,
         the `RunnerUITests` have the same Configuration Set selected as the `Runner`:

      ![Xcode config setup](/assets/ios_runner_configs.png)

      9. Go to **RunnerUITests** -> **Build Phases** and add 2 new "Run Script Phase" Build Phases.
         Name them `xcode_backend build` and `xcode_backend embed_and_thin`.

      ![Xcode config setup](/assets/ios_runner_build_phases_create.png)

      10. Arrange the newly created Build Phases in the order shown in the screenshot below.

      ![Xcode config setup](/assets/ios_runner_build_phases.png)

      11. Paste this code into the `xcode_backend build` Build Phase:

      ```
      /bin/sh "$FLUTTER_ROOT/packages/flutter_tools/bin/xcode_backend.sh" build
      ```

      12. Paste this code into the `xcode_backend embed_and_thin` Build Phase:

      ```
      /bin/sh "$FLUTTER_ROOT/packages/flutter_tools/bin/xcode_backend.sh" embed_and_thin
      ```

      13. Xcode by default also enables a "parallel execution" setting, which
         breaks Patrol. Disable it **for all schemes** (if you have more than one):

      <YouTube id="9LdEJR59fW4" />

      14. Go to **RunnerUITests** -> **Build Settings**, search for **User Script Sandboxing**
         and make sure it's set to **No**.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="macOS setup">

      1. Open `macos/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode.

      2. Create a test target if you do not already have one via `File > New > Target...`
         and select `UI Testing Bundle`. Change the `Product Name` to `RunnerUITests`. Make
         sure `Target to be Tested` is set to `Runner` and language is set to `Objective-C`.
         Select `Finish`.

      3. 2 files are created: `RunnerUITests.m` and `RunnerUITestsLaunchTests.m`.
         Delete `RunnerUITestsLaunchTests.m` **through Xcode**.

      4. Make sure that the **macOS Deployment Target** of `RunnerUITests` within the
         **Build Settings** section is the same as `Runner`.
         The minimum supported **macOS Deployment Target** is `10.14`.

      ![Xcode macOS deployment target](/assets/macos_deployment_target.png)

      ![Xcode macOS deployment target 2](/assets/macos_deployment_target_2.png)

      5. Replace contents of `RunnerUITests.m` file with the following:

      ```objective-c title="macos/RunnerUITests/RunnerUITests.m"
      @import XCTest;
      @import patrol;
      @import ObjectiveC.runtime;

      PATROL_INTEGRATION_TEST_MACOS_RUNNER(RunnerUITests)
      ```

      Add the newly created target to `macos/Podfile` by embedding in the existing
      `Runner` target.

      ```ruby title="macos/Podfile"
      target 'Runner' do
        # Do not change existing lines.
        ...

        target 'RunnerUITests' do
          inherit! :complete
        end
      end
      ```

      6. Create an empty file `integration_test/example_test.dart` in the root of your Flutter project. From the command line, run:

      ```
      $ flutter build macos --config-only integration_test/example_test.dart
      ```

      7. Go to your `macos` directory and run:

      ```
      $ pod install --repo-update
      ```

      8. Go to **RunnerUITests** -> **Build Phases** and add 2 new "Run Script Phase" Build Phases.
         Rename them to `xcode_backend build` and `xcode_backend embed_and_thin` by double clicking
         on their names.

      ![Xcode config setup](/assets/macos_runner_build_phases_create.png)

      9. Arrange the newly created Build Phases in the order shown in the screenshot below.

      ![Xcode config setup](/assets/macos_runner_build_phases.png)

      10. Paste this code into the first `macos_assemble build` Build Phase:

      ```
      /bin/sh "$FLUTTER_ROOT/packages/flutter_tools/bin/macos_assemble.sh" build
      ```

      11. Paste this code into the second `macos_assemble embed` Build Phase:

      ```
      /bin/sh "$FLUTTER_ROOT/packages/flutter_tools/bin/macos_assemble.sh" embed
      ```

      12. Xcode by default also enables a "parallel execution" setting, which
         breaks Patrol. Disable it **for all schemes** (if you have more than one):

      <YouTube id="9LdEJR59fW4" />

      13. Go to **RunnerUITests** -> **Build Settings**, search for **User Script Sandboxing**
         and make sure it's set to **No**.

      14. Go to **Runner** -> **Signing & Capabilities**. Make sure that in all **App Sandbox**
         sections, **Incoming Connections (Server)** and **Outgoing Connections (Client)** checkboxes
         are checked.

      ![Xcode entitlements setup](/assets/macos_entitlements.png)

      15. **Copy** `DebugProfile.entitlements` and `Release.entitlements` files from `macos/Runner`
         to `macos/RunnerUITests` directory.

      16. Go to **RunnerUITests** -> **Build Settings** and set **Code Signing Entitlements** to
         `RunnerUITests/DebugProfile.entitlements` for **Debug** and **Profile** configuration and to
         `RunnerUITests/Release.entitlements` for **Release** configuration.

### Create a simple integration test

Let's create a dummy Flutter integration test that you'll use to verify
that Patrol is correctly set up.

Paste the following code into `integration_test/example_test.dart`:

```dart title="integration_test/example_test.dart"
import 'dart:io';

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:patrol/patrol.dart';

void main() {
  patrolTest(
    'counter state is the same after going to home and switching apps',
    ($) async {
      // Replace later with your app's main widget
      await $.pumpWidgetAndSettle(
        MaterialApp(
          home: Scaffold(
            appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('app')),
            backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
          ),
        ),
      );

      expect($('app'), findsOneWidget);
      if (!Platform.isMacOS) {
        await $.native.pressHome();
      }
    },
  );
}
```

It does only 2 things:

- first, it finds a text `app`
- then (on mobile platforms), it exits to home screen

It's a very simple test, but it's enough to verify that Patrol is correctly set
up. To run `integration_test/example_test.dart` on a connected Android, iOS or macOS device:

      ```
      patrol test -t integration_test/example_test.dart
      ```

      If the setup is successful, you should see a **TEST PASSED** message.
      If something went wrong, please proceed to the [FAQ] section which might
      contain an answer to your issue.

      <Info>
        If your app is using flavors, then you can pass them like so:

        ```
        patrol test --target integration_test/example_test.dart --flavor development
        ```

        or you can specify them in `pubspec.yaml` (recommended):

        ```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
        patrol:
          app_name: My App
          flavor: development
          android:
            package_name: com.example.myapp
          ios:
            bundle_id: com.example.MyApp
            app_name: The Awesome App
          macos:
            bundle_id: com.example.macos.MyApp
        ```
      </Info>

      <Error>
        To prevent issues during Patrol tests, please follow these guidelines:

        1. Do not call `IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized`.
           Patrol automatically initializes its own test binding.
        2. Do not modify the global `FlutterError.onError` callback. Patrol's
           internals depend on it. Keep in mind that this callback can also
           be modified by popular packages such as Sentry or Crashlytics.
           In such cases, you can disable them for Patrol tests.
      </Error>

      <Info>
        If you are looking for a working example of a Flutter app with Patrol tests,
        check out the [example app](https://github.com/leancodepl/patrol/tree/master/packages/patrol/example)
         in the patrol repository.

### FAQ

<Accordion title="Testing fails with error inside 'integration_test/test_bundle.dart'">
  The reason is probably a mismatch of `patrol` and `patrol_cli` versions. Go to [Compatibility table]
  and make sure that the versions of `patrol` and `patrol_cli` you are using are compatible.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="'example_test.dart' passed but I can't get my application to run
within the patrol test.">
  To run your application within the patrol test, you need to call `$.pumpWidgetAndSettle()`,
  and pass your application's main widget to it. Be sure that you registered all the
  necessary services before calling `$.pumpWidgetAndSettle()`.
  Here's the example of running an app within the patrol test:
  ```dart

  void main() {
    patrolTest('real app test', ($) async {

    // Do all the necessary setup here (DI, services, etc.)

    await $.pumpWidgetAndSettle(const MyApp()); // Your's app main widget

    // Start testing your app here

    });
  }

  ```
  It's a good practice to create a setup wrapper function for your tests, so you don't have to
  repeat the same code in every test. Look at the [example](https://github.com/leancodepl/patrol/blob/d2c7493f9399a028e39cb94fd204affdb932c5fc/dev/e2e_app/integration_test/common.dart#L17-L33)
  of a wrapper function.
</Accordion>


#### Android

<Accordion title="Where do I get 'package_name' from?">
  Go to `android/app/build.gradle` and look for `applicationId` in `defaultConfig` section.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Running patrol test fails containing 'Unsupported class file major version' error">
  It's most likely caused by using incompatible JDK version.
  Run `javac -version` to check your JDK version. Patrol officially works on JDK 17,
  so unexpected errors may occur on other versions.
  If you have AndroidStudio or Intellij IDEA installed, you can find the path to JDK by
  opening your project's android directory in AS/Intellij and going to
  **Settings** -> **Build, Execution, Deployment** -> **Build Tools** -> **Gradle** -> **Gradle JDK**.
  [Learn more](https://developer.android.com/build/jdks)
</Accordion>


#### iOS

<Accordion title="Where do I get `bundle_id` from?">
  For iOS go to `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` and look for `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER`.
  For macOS go to `macos/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` and look for `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When I run tests the simulator is getting cloned">
  Make sure that you disabled "Paralell execution" for **all schemes** in Xcode.
  See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LdEJR59fW4) for details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Running test stops on 'Wait for com.example.myapp to idle'">
  Open your XCode project, go to **Runner** target -> **Build Settings**, search for `FLUTTER_TARGET`
  and remove set path to targets for all configurations.
  Alternatively, you can search for a `FLUTTER_TARGET` in your project files and remove it (both value and key)
  from *.xcconfig and *.pbxproj files.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When running a test, real app without test is opened instead">
  Open your XCode project, go to **Runner** target -> **Build Settings**, search for `FLUTTER_TARGET`
  and remove set path to targets for all configurations.
  Alternatively, you can search for a `FLUTTER_TARGET` in your project files and remove it (both value and key)
  from *.xcconfig and *.pbxproj files.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Build is failing with errors on mismatching iOS deployment versions">
  Check if this line in `Podfile` is present and uncommented.
  ```
  platform :ios, '11.0'
  ```
  If yes, then check if **iOS deployment version** in Xcode project's **Build Settings**
  section for all targets (Runner and RunnerUITests) are set to the same value as in Podfile
  (in case presented in snippet above, all should be set to 11.0).
</Accordion>
