**Patrol is an open-source framework created and maintained by LeanCode under the Apache 2.0 License. It will always remain open source.**  
However, if your company wants to scale fast and accelerate Patrol’s adoption, we offer a set of value-added services on top of the core framework.  
Reach out to our team if you'd like support with setting up Patrol in your specific environment or if you're looking for experienced engineers to automate end-to-end testing for your product.  
As the creators of Patrol, we can provide the most accurate guidance on how to achieve your goals efficiently and with confidence.

# Custom Patrol Setup for your Project

## Patrol Setup in Your Project (iOS & Android)

We support your team with a full Patrol implementation, including:

* adding Patrol to both iOS and Android projects  
* adding a Patrol test for one test scenario inside your codebase 
* ensuring the test runs locally on Android and iOS simulators/emulators

## CI/CD Workflow Setup (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, Bitrise)

We configure end-to-end automation for Patrol tests, including:

* building Patrol-enabled app versions for test execution  
* running tests on Firebase Test Lab for both iOS and Android virtual devices  
* scheduling nightly test runs  
* exporting logs as build artifacts  
* generating and displaying test reports.

## Costs and pricing

Patrol as a tool is free of charge and open-sourced. For the companies that want to speed up the adoption of Patrol and want to quickly have their first tests up and running, we recommend using our additional services related to Patrol Setup and Building Patrol Tests. Prices for this service depend on the scale of the project (startups/enterprise) and the number of tests that should be covered during initial setup.
