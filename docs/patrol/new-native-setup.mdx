# Native automation setup

Using Patrol's native automation feature requires more setup work than using
custom finders. Unfortunately it's necessary, because you have to integrate your
app with Android and/or iOS native testing tools.

We believe that the powerful features you'll get will make up for it!

<Warning>
        In this tutorial, we are using example app, which has package name
        `com.example.myapp` on Android, bundle id `com.example.MyApp` on iOS
        and `My App` name on both Android and iOS. Replace any occurences
        of those names with proper values.
</Warning>

### Add dependency on patrol

If you haven't already, add a dependency on the `patrol` package in the
`dev_dependencies` section of **pubspec.yaml**.

```
flutter pub add patrol --dev
```

### Configure Patrol in pubspec.yaml

Create `patrol` section in your **pubspec.yaml**:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  # ...

dev_dependencies:
  # ...

patrol:
  app_name: My App
  android:
    package_name: com.example.myapp
  ios:
    bundle_id: com.example.MyApp
```

### Install patrol_cli

Patrol CLI (command-line interface) is a small program that enables running
Patrol UI tests. It handles the complexity of native iOS and Android testing
tools itself, so you can focus on writing your tests instead of learning yet
another platform-specific tool.

1. Install `patrol_cli` executable:

   ```
   dart pub global activate patrol_cli
   ```

2. Verify that installation was successful and your enviroment is set up properly:

   ```
   patrol doctor
   ```

### Integrate with native side

The 3 first steps were common across platforms. The rest is platform-specific.

Psst... Android is a bit easier to set up, so we recommend starting with it!

<Tabs 
  defaultValue="android" 
  values={[
    { label: "Android", value: "android" },
    { label: "iOS", value: "ios" },
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="android">

      Go to **android/app/src/androidTest/java/com/example/myapp/** in your project
      directory. If there are no such folders, create them.

      Create a file named `MainActivityTest.java` and copy there the code below.

      ```java title="MainActivityTest.java"
      package com.example.myapp; // replace "com.example.myapp" with your app's package

      import androidx.test.platform.app.InstrumentationRegistry;
      import org.junit.Test;
      import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
      import org.junit.runners.Parameterized;
      import org.junit.runners.Parameterized.Parameters;
      import pl.leancode.patrol.PatrolJUnitRunner;

      @RunWith(Parameterized.class)
      public class MainActivityTest {
          @Parameters(name = "{0}")
          public static Object[] testCases() {
              PatrolJUnitRunner instrumentation = (PatrolJUnitRunner) InstrumentationRegistry.getInstrumentation();
              instrumentation.setUp(MainActivity.class);
              instrumentation.waitForPatrolAppService();
              return instrumentation.listDartTests();
          }

          public MainActivityTest(String dartTestName) {
              this.dartTestName = dartTestName;
          }

          private final String dartTestName;

          @Test
          public void runDartTest() {
              PatrolJUnitRunner instrumentation = (PatrolJUnitRunner) InstrumentationRegistry.getInstrumentation();
              instrumentation.runDartTest(dartTestName);
          }
      }
      ```

      Go to the **biuld.gradle** file, located in **android/app** folder in your
      project directory.

      Add these 2 lines to the `defaultConfig` section:

      ```groovy
        testInstrumentationRunner "pl.leancode.patrol.PatrolJUnitRunner"
        testInstrumentationRunnerArguments clearPackageData: "true"
      ```

      Add these section to the `android` section:

      ```groovy
        testOptions {
          execution "ANDROIDX_TEST_ORCHESTRATOR"
        }
      ```

      Add this line to `dependencies` section:

      ```groovy
        androidTestUtil "androidx.test:orchestrator:1.4.2"
      ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ios">

      Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode. Create a test target if you
      do not already have one via `File > New > Target...` and select `UI Testing Bundle`.
      Change the `Product Name` to `RunnerUITests`. Make sure `Target to be Tested` is set to `Runner` and language is set to `Objective-C`.
      Select `Finish`.

      2 files are created: `RunnerUITests.m` and `RunnerUITestsLaunchTests.m`.
      Delete `RunnerUITestsLaunchTests.m` **through Xcode**.

      Make sure that the **iOS Deployment Target** of `RunnerUITests` within the
      **Build Settings** section is the same as `Runner`.
      The minimum supported **iOS Deployment Target** is `13.0`.

      ![Xcode iOS deployment target](/assets/ios_deployment_target.png)

      ![Xcode iOS deployment target 2](/assets/ios_deployment_target_2.png)

      Replace contents of `RunnerUITests.m` file with the following:

      ```objective-c title="ios/RunnerUITests/RunnerUITests.m"
      @import XCTest;
      @import patrol;
      @import ObjectiveC.runtime;

      PATROL_INTEGRATION_TEST_IOS_RUNNER(RunnerUITests)
      ```

      Add the newly created target to `ios/Podfile` by embedding in the existing
      `Runner` target.

      ```ruby title="ios/Podfile"
      target 'Runner' do
        # Do not change existing lines.
        ...

        target 'RunnerUITests' do
          inherit! :complete
        end
      end
      ```

      To build `integration_test/example_test.dart` from the command line, run:

      ```
      $ flutter build ios --config-only integration_test/example_test.dart
      ```

      Now, go to your `ios` directory and set up the new target:

      ```
      $ pod install --repo-update
      ```

      Open your Xcode project and make sure every target has correct base
      Build Configurations:

      ```
      $ open Runner.xcworkspace
      ```

      ![Xcode config setup](/assets/ios_runner_configs.png)

      RunnerUITests depends on Patrol, which depens on Flutter, so we need to
      tell Xcode to embed Flutter in the RunnerUITests target. To do this, add
      2 new "Run Script Phase" Build Phases to the RunnerUITests target:

      ![Xcode config setup](/assets/ios_runner_build_phases.png)

      Paste this code into the first `xcode_backend build` Build Phase:

      ```
      /bin/sh "$FLUTTER_ROOT/packages/flutter_tools/bin/xcode_backend.sh" build
      ```

      Paste this code into the second `xcode_backend embed_and_thin` Build Phase:

      ```
      /bin/sh "$FLUTTER_ROOT/packages/flutter_tools/bin/xcode_backend.sh" embed_and_thin
      ```

      Xcode by default also enables a "parallel execution" setting, which
      breaks Patrol. Disable it:

      <Info>
        If your app is using flavors, then you can pass them like so:

        ```
        patrol test --target integration_test/example_test.dart --flavor development
        ```

        or you can specify them in **pubspec.yaml** (recommended):

        ```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
        patrol:
          app_name: Awesome App
          flavor: development
          android:
            package_name: pl.leancode.awesomeapp
          ios:
            bundle_id: pl.leancode.AwesomeApp
            app_name: The Awesome App
        ```
      </Info>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Create a simple integration test

Let's create a dummy Flutter integration test that you'll use to verify
that Patrol is correctly set up.

Paste the following code into `integration_test/example_test.dart`:

```dart title="integration_test/example_test.dart"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:patrol/patrol.dart';

void main() {
  patrolTest(
    'counter state is the same after going to home and switching apps',
    nativeAutomation: true,
    ($) async {
      // Replace later with your app's main widget
      await $.pumpWidgetAndSettle(
        MaterialApp(
          home: Scaffold(
            appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('app')),
            backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
          ),
        ),
      );

      expect($('app'), findsOneWidget);
      await $.native.pressHome();
    },
  );
}
```

It does only 2 things:

- first, it finds a text `app`
- then, it then exits to home screen

It's a very simple test, but it's enough to verify that Patrol is correctly set
up. To run `integration_test/example_test.dart` on a local Android or iOS device
      (emulated or physical):

      ```
      patrol test -t integration_test/example_test.dart
      ```

      If the setup is successful, you should see a **TEST PASSED** message.

      <Info>
        If your app is using flavors, then you can pass them like so:

        ```
        patrol test --target integration_test/example_test.dart --flavor development
        ```

        or you can specify them in **pubspec.yaml** (recommended):

        ```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
        patrol:
          app_name: Awesome App
          flavor: development
          android:
            package_name: pl.leancode.awesomeapp
          ios:
            bundle_id: pl.leancode.AwesomeApp
            app_name: The Awesome App
        ```
      </Info>
