# Getting started

Patrol consists of 2 packages:

- [patrol] â€“ the core package
- [patrol_cli] - the CLI app which enables the [native automation feature]

There are two ways of using Patrol - to create **E2E UI tests** which contain 
testing **native features of your app** (eg. localization permissions) or to **enhance** your experience of writing 
**widget tests** by making use of our **custom finders**. Depending of which way you want to go, 
head over to [native setup] or [custom finders setup].
