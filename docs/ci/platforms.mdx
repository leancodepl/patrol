In this document we'll outline a few ways for running Patrol UI tests of Flutter
apps.

Generally, the solutions for running UI tests of mobile apps can be divided into
2 groups:

- Device labs - platforms that provide access mobile devices in the cloud. You
  upload an app binary with tests to the device lab, which runs the tests and
  reports the results back to you.

- Traditional – containers or a VM, either managed or self-hosted. In this
  approach, you get access to the shell, so everything is possible. You manually
  script what you want to achieve, which is usually: installing the Android/iOS
  SDK tools, creating a virtual device, running tests, and collecting results.

There are quite a few solutions in each of these groups, and each is unique, but
generaly, **device labs trade flexibility for ease of use**. They're a good fit
for most apps but make certain more complicated scenarios impossible.

# Device labs

### Firebase Test Lab

[Firebase Test Lab] is one of the most popular device labs. It is a good choice
for most projects.

You upload the app main app, the test app, select devices to run on, and after a
while, test results along with a video recording are available.

Firebase Test Lab has a large pool of physical and virtual devices.

### emulator.wtf

[emulator.wtf] is a fairly new solution created by the people at CodeMagic. It
claims to provide a 2-5x speedup compared to Firebase Test Lab, and 4-20x
speedup compared to spawning emulators on CI machines. It works similarly to
Firebase Test Lab - you upload your main apk, test apk, select emulators to run
on, and the rest is up to emulator.wtf - it runs the tests and outputs results.

The emulators are indeed rock stable. Emulator.wtf automatically records videos
from test runs, and it presents the test results nicely.

It's a solid choice if you can accept that your tests will run only on Android
emulator.

Reports are available in JUnit.

### Xcode Cloud

[Xcode Cloud] is a CI/CD platform built into Xcode and designed expressly for
Apple developers. It doesn't support testing on Android.

Since integration tests written with Patrol are also native `XCTest`s, it should
be possible to run Patrol on Xcode Cloud.

We did not test check it yet.

### Other

Another popular device lab is [AWS Device Farm].

If you use-case is highly specific, you might want to build an in-house device
farm. A project that helps with this is [Simple Test Farm].

### Limitations

We mentioned above that device labs make certain scenarios impossible to
accomplish.

An example of such scenario scanning a QR code. One of the apps we worked on had
this feature, and we wanted to test it because it was critical part of the user
flow. When you have access to the shell filesystem (which you do have in the
"manual" approach, and don't have in the "device lab" approach), you can easily
[replace the scene that is visible in the camera's viewfinder][so_viewfinder].

This is no possible on device labs.

# Traditional

### GitHub Actions

[GitHub Actions] is a very popular CI/CD platforms, especially among open-source
projects thanks to unlimited minutes.

Unfortunately, running Flutter integration tests on GitHub Actions is not a
pleasant experience.

**Android**

We used the [ReactiveCircus/android-emulator-runner] GitHub Action to run
Android emulator on GitHub Actions. Our takeaway is this: Running an Android
emulator on default GitHub Actions runner is a bad idea. It is slow to start and
unstable (apps crash randomly) and very slow. Really, really slow. We tried to
mitigate its instability by using [Test Butler], but it comes with its own
restrictions, most notably, it doesn't allow for Google Play Services.

**iOS**

We use the [futureware-tech/simulator-action] GitHub Action to run iOS simulator
on GitHub Actions is stable. But given that iOS simulator is just that – a
simulator, not an emulator – the range of cases it can be used for is reduced.
For example, there's no easy way to disable internet connection, which makes it
very hard to test behavior of an app when offline.

Bear in mind that to run an iOS simulator on GitHub Actions, you have to use a
macOS runner. 1 minute on macos-latest counts as 10 minutes on ubuntu-latest.
You can also use a custom runner – more on that below.

Custom Runners Workflows on GitHub Actions can run on external runners, in
addition to default runners such as ubuntu-latest and macos-latest.

One example of such a custom runner provider is BuildJet. We tried running
Android emulator on it, hoping that the performance benefits it brings would
help with the abysmal stability, but we've found that, even though the emulator
works faster and is more stable, it sometimes just crashes with no actionable
error message.

### Other

There are many more CI/CD platforms. Some of the most popular include
[CircleCI], [CirrusCI], and [GitLab CI/CD]. There are also CI providers that are
focused specifically on mobile apps, for example [Bitrise] and [Codemagic]. We
did not check whether running Flutter integration tests works fine on them, so
we can't say more about them. If you did, we (and other Patrol users) will be
happy to hear about your experiences!
