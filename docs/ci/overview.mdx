# Continuous Integration

This section of the documentation is focused on running Patrol tests as part of
your Continuous Integration workflows.

Having tests doesn't bring you any benefits if you don't automatically verify
that they pass. We know this too well, and we're putting a lot of work into
making it easy to do so.
