# Native automation setup

Using Patrol's native automation feature requires more setup work than using
custom finders. Unfortunately it's necessary, because you have to integrate your
app with Android and/or iOS native testing tools.

We believe that the powerful features you'll get will make up for it!

### Add dependency on patrol

If you haven't already, add a dependency on the `patrol` package in the
`dev_dependencies` section of **pubspec.yaml**.

```
flutter pub add patrol --dev
```

### Configure Patrol in pubspec.yaml

Create `patrol` section in your **pubspec.yaml**:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  # ...

dev_dependencies:
  # ...

patrol:
  app_name: Awesome App
  android:
    package_name: pl.leancode.awesomeapp
  ios:
    bundle_id: pl.leancode.AwesomeApp
```

<Info>
  If your app has different name on iOS and Android, you can specify `app_name`
  twice – one in `android` block, and one in `ios` block.
</Info>

Of course, replace these placeholders with values specific to your app!

We highly recommend performing this step, because it enables the following
features:

- Patrol will automatically uninstall your app after every test (using
  `package_name` and `bundle_id`). This will make the environment which your
  tests run in more stable and predictable.
- Patrol will be able to tap on your app's notifications (using `app_name`)

### Install patrol_cli

Patrol CLI (command-line interface) is a small program that makes it easier to
run Flutter integration tests using Patrol's native automation feature. It
handles the complexity of native iOS and Android testing tools itself, so you
can focus on writing your tests instead of learning yet another
platform-specific tool.

1. Install `patrol` executable:

   ```
   dart pub global activate patrol_cli
   ```

  <Info>
    You can install a specific version of Patrol CLI. For example:

    ```
    dart pub global activate patrol_cli ^1.0.0
    ```

    will install the latest `v1` version. We recommend to install a specific
    version on CI systems to avoid unexpected breakages.

  </Info>

2. Verify that installation was successful:

   ```
   patrol --version
   ```

Also make sure to update Patrol CLI from time to time:

```
patrol update
```

### Create a simple integration test

Let's create a dummy Flutter integration test that you'll use later to verify
that Patrol is correctly set up.

Paste the following code into `integration_test/example_test.dart`:

```dart title="integration_test/example_test.dart"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:patrol/patrol.dart';

void main() {
  patrolTest(
    'counter state is the same after going to home and switching apps',
    nativeAutomation: true,
    ($) async {
      // Replace later with your app's main widget
      await $.pumpWidgetAndSettle(
        MaterialApp(
          home: Scaffold(
            appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('app')),
            backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
          ),
        ),
      );

      expect($('app'), findsOneWidget);
      await $.native.pressHome();
    },
  );
}
```

It does only 2 things:

- first, it finds a widget with the `app` key
- then, it then exits to home screen

It's a very simple test, but it's enough to verify that Patrol is correctly set
up – **but not just yet**. You still have to integrate the native part of your
app with the respective platform's test framework. That's the last thing to do.

### Integrate with native side

The 3 first steps were common across platforms. The rest is platform-specific.

Psst... Android is a bit easier to set up, so we recommend starting with it!

<Tabs 
  defaultValue="android" 
  values={[
    { label: "Android", value: "android" },
    { label: "iOS", value: "ios" },
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="android">
    
      Create an instrumentation test file in your application's
      **android/app/src/androidTest/java/com/example/myapp/** directory (replacing
      com, example, and myapp with values from your app's package name). You can name
      this test file `MainActivityTest.java` or another name of your choice.

      ```java title="MainActivityTest.java"
      package pl.leancode.patrol.example; // replace "pl.leancode.patrol.example" with your app's package

      import androidx.test.platform.app.InstrumentationRegistry;
      import org.junit.Test;
      import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
      import org.junit.runners.Parameterized;
      import org.junit.runners.Parameterized.Parameters;
      import pl.leancode.patrol.PatrolJUnitRunner;

      @RunWith(Parameterized.class)
      public class MainActivityTest {
          @Parameters(name = "{0}")
          public static Object[] testCases() {
              PatrolJUnitRunner instrumentation = (PatrolJUnitRunner) InstrumentationRegistry.getInstrumentation();
              instrumentation.setUp(MainActivity.class);
              instrumentation.waitForPatrolAppService();
              return instrumentation.listDartTests();
          }

          public MainActivityTest(String dartTestName) {
              this.dartTestName = dartTestName;
          }

          private final String dartTestName;

          @Test
          public void runDartTest() {
              PatrolJUnitRunner instrumentation = (PatrolJUnitRunner) InstrumentationRegistry.getInstrumentation();
              instrumentation.runDartTest(dartTestName);
          }
      }
      ```

      <Warning>
        In the snippet above, remember to replace the
        `package pl.leancode.patrol.example` line at the top of the file with
        your app's package name!
      </Warning>


      Next, update your **app-level build.gradle**:

      ```groovy title="android/app/build.gradle"
      android {
        // ...
        defaultConfig {
          //...
          testInstrumentationRunner "pl.leancode.patrol.PatrolJUnitRunner"
        }

        // ...

        testOptions {
          execution "ANDROIDX_TEST_ORCHESTRATOR"
        }
      }

      dependencies {
          androidTestUtil "androidx.test:orchestrator:1.4.2"
      }
      ```

      <Info>
        To achieve full isolation between test runs, enable the `clearPackageOption`:

        ```groovy title="android/app/build.gradle"
        defaultConfig {
          //...
          testInstrumentationRunner "pl.leancode.patrol.PatrolJUnitRunner"
          testInstrumentationRunnerArguments clearPackageData: "true"
        }
        ```

        This will clear the app's data and permissions before each test run.
        Unfortunately, no equivalent feature is available on iOS.

      </Info>

      To run `integration_test/example_test.dart` on a local Android device
      (emulated or physical):

      ```
      patrol test --target integration_test/example_test.dart
      ```

      If the setup is successful, you should see a **TEST PASSED** message.

      <Info>
        If your app is using flavors, then you can pass them like so:

        ```
        patrol test --target integration_test/example_test.dart --flavor development
        ```

        or you can specify them in **pubspec.yaml** (recommended):

        ```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
        patrol:
          app_name: Awesome App
          flavor: development
          android:
            package_name: pl.leancode.awesomeapp
          ios:
            bundle_id: pl.leancode.AwesomeApp
            app_name: The Awesome App
        ```

        If you're a tester and you're unsure what flavors are and if your app is
        using them, ask the developer and they'll surely help you.
      </Info>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ios">

      Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode. Create a test target if you
      do not already have one via `File > New > Target...` and select `UI Testing Bundle`.
      Change the `Product Name` to `RunnerUITests`. Make sure `Target to be Tested` is set to `Runner` and language is set to `Objective-C`.
      Select `Finish`.

      2 files are created: `RunnerUITests.m` and `RunnerUITestsLaunchTests.m`.
      Delete `RunnerUITestsLaunchTests.m` **through Xcode**.

      Make sure that the **iOS Deployment Target** of `RunnerUITests` within the
      **Build Settings** section is the same as `Runner`.
      The minimum supported **iOS Deployment Target** is `13.0`.

      ![Xcode iOS deployment target](/assets/ios_deployment_target.png)

      ![Xcode iOS deployment target 2](/assets/ios_deployment_target_2.png)

      Replace contents of `RunnerUITests.m` file with the following:

      ```objective-c title="ios/RunnerUITests/RunnerUITests.m"
      @import XCTest;
      @import patrol;
      @import ObjectiveC.runtime;

      PATROL_INTEGRATION_TEST_IOS_RUNNER(RunnerUITests)
      ```

      Add the newly created target to `ios/Podfile` by embedding in the existing
      `Runner` target.

      ```ruby title="ios/Podfile"
      target 'Runner' do
        # Do not change existing lines.
        ...

        target 'RunnerUITests' do
          inherit! :complete
        end
      end
      ```

      To build `integration_test/example_test.dart` from the command line, run:

      ```
      $ flutter build ios --config-only integration_test/example_test.dart
      ```

      Now, go to your `ios` directory and set up the new target:

      ```
      $ pod install --repo-update
      ```

      Open your Xcode project and make sure every target has correct base
      Build Configurations:

      ```
      $ open Runner.xcworkspace
      ```

      ![Xcode config setup](/assets/ios_runner_configs.png)

      RunnerUITests depends on Patrol, which depens on Flutter, so we need to
      tell Xcode to embed Flutter in the RunnerUITests target. To do this, add
      2 new "Run Script Phase" Build Phases to the RunnerUITests target:

      ![Xcode config setup](/assets/ios_runner_build_phases.png)

      Paste this code into the first `xcode_backend build` Build Phase:

      ```
      /bin/sh "$FLUTTER_ROOT/packages/flutter_tools/bin/xcode_backend.sh" build
      ```

      Paste this code into the second `xcode_backend embed_and_thin` Build Phase:

      ```
      /bin/sh "$FLUTTER_ROOT/packages/flutter_tools/bin/xcode_backend.sh" embed_and_thin
      ```

      Xcode by default also enables a "parallel execution" setting, which
      breaks Patrol. Disable it:

      <YouTube id="9LdEJR59fW4" />

      To run the test on a local iOS device (simulated or physical):

      ```
      patrol test --target integration_test/example_test.dart
      ```

      If the setup is successful, the test should pass.

      <Info>
        If your app is using flavors, then you can pass them like so:

        ```
        patrol test --target integration_test/example_test.dart --flavor development
        ```

        or you can specify them in **pubspec.yaml** (recommended):

        ```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
        patrol:
          app_name: Awesome App
          flavor: development
          android:
            package_name: pl.leancode.awesomeapp
          ios:
            bundle_id: pl.leancode.AwesomeApp
            app_name: The Awesome App
        ```

### What did you just do?

If you've diligently followed the above steps and `patrol test` prints a **TEST
PASSED** message, you might be now thinking: what did I just do?

The answer is: You've just integrated Flutter testing with native Android/iOS
testing frameworks. This means that your Flutter integration tests can now be
run as _native tests_.

### What are native tests good for, anyway?

iOS and Android have existed for more than 15 years, and during that time many
of awesome testing-related things were built around them – open-source test
runners, device farms, HTML report generators. Developers who create native
mobile apps can easily reap benefits from this huge, mature ecosystem.

Meanwhile we, Flutter developers, don't have as much at our disposal. Our
framework is much younger and less mature.

What if we could masquerade our Flutter tests so that from the outside they
would be truly native? This way we leverage many existing tools while
maintaining the convenience of writing the tests in pure Dart.

> For example, you can run your Patrol tests directly from Xcode. Xcode knows
> nothing about Flutter, Dart and Patrol – it only launches your test app.
> Flutter tests are then run inside the test app and the results are reported
> back to Xcode. This way you get the best of both worlds – the maturity of
> native iOS development and the productivity of Flutter and Dart.

That's exactly what Patrol does (and what the default [integration_test] package
does at well, but at a bit smaller scale).

Take a look at this simple Flutter integration tests using Patrol:

```dart title="integration_test/example_test.dart"
void main() {
  patrolTest(
    'counter state is the same after going to Home and switching apps',
    nativeAutomation: true,
    nativeAutomatorConfig: NativeAutomatorConfig(
      packageName: 'pl.leancode.patrol.example',
      bundleId: 'pl.leancode.patrol.Example',
    ),
    ($) async {
      await $.pumpWidget(ExampleApp());

      await $(FloatingActionButton).tap();
      expect($(#counterText).text, '1');

      await $.native.pressHome();
      await $.native.openApp();

      expect($(#counterText).text, '1');

      await $(FloatingActionButton).tap();
      expect($(#counterText).text, '2');
    },
  );
}
```

You can run this test and view its results in many ways, using all sorts of
different tools, platforms, and IDEs:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="studio"
  values={[
    { label: "Android Studio", value: "studio" },
    { label: "Xcode", value: "xcode" },

    { label: "Gradle", value: "gradle" },
    { label: "fastlane scan", value: "xcpretty" },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="studio">
    When Android test finishes, its test results are automatically generated in
    `build/app/outputs/androidTest-results/connected/test-result.pb`. To view
    them in Android Studio, use the `Run > Import tests from file` option.

    You don't have to use the bulky Android Studio to view your test results,

    With the help of awesome [fastlane scan] you can prettify the output of
    `xcodebuild` to make it easier to understand and generate HTML summary of
    your tests.
