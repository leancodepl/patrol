# Getting started

Patrol consists of 2 packages:

- [patrol] – the core package
- [patrol_cli] - the CLI app to run tests that use the [native automation
  feature].

There are two ways of using Patrol:

- creating **end-to-end UI tests** that have the ability to interact with the
  **native features of your app** (eg. permission dialogs, notifications)

- enhancing your experience of developing **widget tests** by using our **custom
  finders**.

The next two sections guide you through the setup needed to start using Patrol
in your Flutter app project.

[Native automation setup] guides you through the full setup needed to run tests
that use the [native automation feature]. You don't need to go through this
section if you only want to use custom finders.

[Custom finders setup] is much shorter than [native automation setup], since it
only covers the setup needed to use our [custom finders feature] in your widget
tests. Much of what it covers is already covered in [native setup].
