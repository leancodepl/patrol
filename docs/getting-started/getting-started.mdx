# What you can use Patrol for?

Patrol consists of 2 packages:

- [patrol] â€“ the core package
- [patrol_cli] - the CLI app to run tests.

There are two ways of using Patrol - creating **E2E UI tests** which contain 
testing **native features of your app** (eg. localization permissions) or **enhancing** your experience of writing 
**widget tests** by making use of our **custom finders**. 

Next two sections contain steps needed to setup Patrol in your project. [Native setup] will guide you through full setup, 
so you can run tests which use our native automation features. [Custom finders setup] is not necessary if you have already completed the native one,
but if you haven't, it will show you what you need to do in order to use our custom finders in your widget tests.
