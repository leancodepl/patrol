## Comparison with other testing frameworks

### How is it different from `integration_test`?

Patrol builds on top of the [integration_test package][integration_test]. This
means that you can do everything that package:integration_test can do, plus some
additional, awesome things.

### How is it different from Appium?

Appium is one of the most the most popular tool for automating mobile app
testing. It has a big community and there are lots of resources on the internet
on it. Unfortunately, we found that Appium doesn't fit well into Flutter world.
Actually, the idea for Patrol was born out of our frustration with trying to
use Appium for testing Flutter apps.

1. Appium does not feel native to Flutter. To use it, you need `Node.js`, and
   you need to use `npm`. You used 1 language in your app (Dart), and now you
   got the second one. It's setup is cumbersome.

1. Patrol lets you do [greybox testing][greybox], while Appium lets you do
   [blackbox testing][blackbox].

1. Appium is much more mature than Patrol.

TODO: Make sure that the above is correct. One can write Appium client in Dart.

TODO: bash appium more with some better arguments
