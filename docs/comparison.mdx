## Comparison with other testing frameworks

### How is it different from `integration_test`?

Patrol builds on top of the [integration_test package][integration_test]. This
means that you can do everything that the `integration_test` package can do,
plus some additional, awesome things.

### How is it different from Appium?

Appium is one of the most popular tool for automating mobile app
testing. It has a big community and there are lots of resources on the internet
on it. Unfortunately, we found that Appium doesn't fit well into Flutter world.
Actually, the idea for Patrol was born out of our frustration with trying to use
Appium for testing Flutter apps of various sizes.

1. Appium does not feel native to Flutter. To use it, you need `Node.js`, and
   you need to use `npm`. You used 1 language in your app (Dart), and now you
   got the second one. It's setup is also very cumbersome.

1. While Patrol lets you do [greybox testing][greybox], Appium forces you to do
   [blackbox testing][blackbox]. This means that you know nothing about Flutter,
   e.g its widget/element/render tress, cubits, and such.

1. Appium is much more mature than Patrol.

### How is it different from Maestro?

[Maestro by mobile.dev][evil_maestro] is a new cross-platform mobile testing
framework.

1. Maestro interacts with your app using the accessibility tree, which means
   you're doing pure [blackbox testing][blackbox] (same as Appium).

1. Maestro workflows are defined in YAML, while Patrol's test files are normal
   Dart test files. With Patrol, you can express any logic because you're using
   a real programming language.

1. Maestro workflows run much faster than Flutter integration tests which Patrol
   uses. It is because Maestro doesn't recompile your app, but only inspects its
   accessibility tree.
