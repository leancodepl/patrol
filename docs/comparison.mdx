## Comparison with other testing frameworks

### How is it different from `integration_test`?

Patrol builds on top of the [integration_test package][integration_test]. This
means that you can do everything that the `integration_test` package can do,
plus some additional, awesome things.

### How is it different from Appium?

[Appium][appium] is one of the most popular tools for automating mobile app
testing. It has a big community and there are lots of resources on the internet
on it. Unfortunately, we found that Appium doesn't fit well into Flutter world.
Actually, the idea for Patrol was born out of our frustration with trying to use
Appium for testing Flutter apps of various sizes.

1. Appium does not feel native to Flutter. To use it, you need `Node.js`, and
   you need to use `npm`. You used 1 language in your app (Dart), and now you
   got the second one. Its setup process is very cumbersome.

1. While Patrol lets you do [greybox testing][greybox], Appium forces you to do
   [blackbox testing][blackbox]. This means that you know nothing about Flutter,
   e.g its widget/element/render tress, cubits, and such.

1. Appium is much more mature than Patrol.

### How is it different from Maestro?

[Maestro by mobile.dev][evil_maestro] is a new cross-platform mobile testing
framework.

1. Maestro is a blackbox testing tool

   It interacts with your app using the accessibility tree, which means you're
   doing pure [blackbox testing][blackbox] (same as Appium).

1. Maestro workflows are defined in YAML

   They look simple and powerful, and even let you express control flow
   constructs such as if statements and for loops. Trying to build a
   Turing-complete language for testing on top of YAML is definitely
   interesting, but it doesn't sound like an exceptionally good idea to us.

   When you use Patrol, you write normal Dart code in normal Dart files. Thanks
   to that, you can express any logic because you're using a real programming
   language with a mature toolchain.

1. Running Maestro workflows doesn't require a rebuild

   Maestro works by inspecting your app's accessibility tree. It doesn't have to
   know anything about its internals, which means that you don't have to rebuild
   an app if you've edited your Maestro workflow file. Thanks to this, Maestro
   workflows run much faster than Flutter integration tests (which Patrol is
   based on).

### How is it different from Fluttium?

[Fluttium][fluttium] has a very similar approach to Maestro, sharing the same
pros and cons.

1. It cannot interact with native UI components (unlike Patrol and Maestro),
   because it uses Flutter's accessibility tree.

### How is it different from Honey?

[Honey][honey] also has a very similar to Maestro and Fluttium, sharing most of
the same pros and cons.

1. It cannot interact with native UI components (unlike Patrol and Maestro),
   because it uses Flutter's accessibility tree.
