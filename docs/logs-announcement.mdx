title: Improved logging and reporting is here!
---

We’ve made some major improvements to how you can monitor and analyze your tests! With Patrol 3.13.0 and later, you’ll get:

 - Verbose logging: Test names are now displayed in real time as they’re executed!
 - Detailed step reporting: See every action Patrol takes during your test execution, giving you deeper insights into the process.
 - Flutter logs in console: Now you can access Flutter logs directly within the patrol test output, streamlining debugging and analysis.
These enhancements will make it easier than ever to understand what's happening behind the code.

For a full breakdown of these updates, check out the [Logs and test results][logs] page!
