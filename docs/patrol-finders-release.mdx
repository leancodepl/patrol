# New package - `patrol_finders`
We're introducing [`patrol_finders`] - a new package in Patrol framework! It was
created to make it easier to use Patrol finders in widget tests.

### How to use it?

We made a short tutorial on how to use `patrol_finders` package separately
in widget tests, you can find it in [Using Patrol finders in widget tests]
section.

### Does this change affect my Patrol tests?

If you have already some Patrol tests in your project, there are no breaking
changes in this release - everything works the same as before. Though you may
see some deprecation warnings in your code - you can get your code aligned with
them to prepare for future changes.

### What to do with `nativeAutomation` flag?

Despite the deprecation message that is written for this parameter of
`patrolTest()` method, you should not remove it yet in your UI tests. This flag
will be removed in next major release and the default value of it will be set
to `true`.

It means, that if you are using `patrolTest()` method to write widget tests, we
recommend you to migrate to `patrolWidgetTest()` method from `patrol_finders`
package, which is essentially a version of `patrolTest` method with
`nativeAutomation` set to `false`. `patrolTest()` method will have
`nativeAutomation` set to `true` unconditionally in next major version.
