# Usage

Once set up, interacting with the native UI using Patrol is very easy!

### The basics

After you've got your `NativeAutomator` object, you simply call methods on it
and it does the magic.

To enter text into a native view (for example, a form in a WebView):

```dart
await $.native.enterText(
  Selector(text: 'Enter your email'),
  text: 'bartek@awesome.com',
);
```

To tap on a native view (for example, a button in a WebView):

```dart
await $.native.tap(Selector(text: 'Sign up for newsletter'));
```

The above are the simplest, most common actions, but they already make it
possible to test scenarios that were impossible to test before, such as
WebViews.

### Going deeper

To open the notification shade:

```dart
await $.native.openNotifications();
```

To open the notification shade and tap on the first notfication:

```dart
await $.native.tapOnNotificationByIndex(1);
```

To handle the permission prompt:

```dart
await $.native.grantPermissionWhenInUse();
await $.native.grantPermissionOnlyThisTime();
await $.native.denyPermission();
```

If the shown permission prompt is the location prompt, you can also select the
accuracy:

```dart
await $.native.selectFineLocation();
await $.native.selectCoarseLocation();
```

The test will fail if the permission prompt is not visible. You can check if it
is with:

```dart
if (await $.native.isPermissionDialogVisible()) {
  await $.native.grantPermissionWhenInUse();
}
```

By default, `isPermissionDialogVisible()` waits for a short amount of time and
then returns `false` if the dialog is not visible. To increase the timeout:

```dart
if (await $.native.isPermissionDialogVisible(timeout: Duration(seconds: 5))) {
  await $.native.grantPermissionWhenInUse();
}
```
