# Usage

Once set up, interacting with the native UI with Patrol is very easy!

### Intro

**TL;DR:** Use `patrol drive` instead of `flutter test`

To enable interaction with native UI, Patrol has to:

1. Downlad and install artifacts

   Artifacts are zipped iOS and Android apps which are downloaded from the
   internet to the artifacts directory. When you `patrol drive`, these apps are
   installed on the target device.

   Artifacts are downloaded and updated automatically by the CLI, so you don't
   need to worry about them at all. If you want to see where artifacts are
   stored on your machine, run `patrol doctor`.

1. Run the native automation server

   An infinite XCUITest (on iOS) or UIAutomator (on Android) test is run, which
   starts the Patrol automation server.

   The automation server is a simple HTTP server which you communicate with
   every time you use native platform capabilites.

That's why you must use `patrol drive` instead of `flutter test` to run
integration tests. Technically, you could do everything that `patrol drive` does
yourself, but fortunately, you don't have to.

### The basics

After you've got your `NativeAutomator` object, you simply call methods on it
and it does the magic.

To enter text into a native view (for example, a form in a WebView):

```dart
await $.native.enterText(
  Selector(text: 'Enter your email'),
  text: 'bartek@awesome.com',
);
```

To tap on a native view (for example, a button in a WebView):

```dart
await $.native.tap(Selector(text: 'Sign up for newsletter'));
```

The above are the simplest, most common actions, but they already make it
possible to test scenarios that were impossible to test before, such as
WebViews.

### Going deeper

To open the notification shade:

```dart
await $.native.openNotifications();
```

To open the notification shade and tap on the first notfication:

```dart
await $.native.tapOnNotificationByIndex(1);
```

To handle the permission prompt:

```dart
await $.native.grantPermissionWhenInUse();
await $.native.grantPermissionOnlyThisTime();
await $.native.denyPermission();
```

If the shown permission prompt is the location prompt, you can also select the
accuracy:

```dart
await $.native.selectFineLocation();
await $.native.selectCoarseLocation();
```

The test will fail if the permission prompt is not visible. You can check if it
is with:

```dart
if (await $.native.isPermissionDialogVisible()) {
  await $.native.grantPermissionWhenInUse();
}
```

By default, `isPermissionDialogVisible()` waits for a short amount of time and
then returns `false` if the dialog is not visible. To increase the timeout:

```dart
if (await $.native.isPermissionDialogVisible(timeout: Duration(seconds: 5))) {
  await $.native.grantPermissionWhenInUse();
}
```
