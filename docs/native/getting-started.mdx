## Getting started

Once set up, interacting with the native UI with Patrol is very easy!

### Intro

**TL;DR:** Use `patrol drive` instead of `flutter test`

To enable interaction with native UI, Patrol has to:

1. Install artifacts

   Artifacts are zipped iOS and Android apps which are downloaded from the
   internet to the artifacts directory. When you `patrol drive`, these apps are
   installed on the target device.

   Artifacts are downloaded and updated automatically by the CLI, so you don't
   need to worry about them at all. If you want to see where artifacts are
   stored on your machine, run `patrol doctor`.

1. Forward ports

   If needed, ports are forwarded to enable communication between your machine
   (the host) and the target device (which can be a Android emulator, iOS
   Simulator, or a physical device)

1. Run the native automation server

   An infinite XCUITest (on iOS) or UIAutomator (on Android) test is run, which
   starts the Patrol automation server.

   The automation server is a simple HTTP server which you communicate with
   every time you use native platform capabilites.

That's why you must use `patrol drive` instead of `flutter test` to run
integration tests. Technically, you could do everything that `patrol drive` does
yourself, but fortunately, you don't have to.

### Initializing `NativeAutomator`

The class which is responsible for native interactions is [NativeAutomator].

You can initialize it in 2 ways:

**Automatically (recommended)**

It makes `NativeAutomator` available as `PatrolTester.native`. In the rest of
documentation we'll use this way.

```dart
// integration_test/app_test.dart

void main() {
  patrolTest(
    'test description',
    config: patrolConfig,
    nativeAutomation: true,
    (PatrolTester $) async {
      await $.native.pressHome();
      // more test code
    },
  );
}
```

**Manually**

This is useful if, for any reason, you have to use `testWidgets`.

```dart
// integration_test/app_test.dart

void main() {
  final automator = NativeAutomator.forTest();

  testWidgets(
    'test description',
    (WidgetTester tester) async {
      await automator.pressHome();
      // more test code
    },
  );
}
```

### Using `NativeAutomator`

After you've got your `NativeAutomator` object, you just call methods on it and
it does magic.

To enter text into a native view (for example, a form in a WebView):

```dart
await $.native.enterText(
    Selector(text: 'Enter your email'),
    text: 'bartek@awesome.com',
  );
```

To tap on a native view (for example, a button in a WebView):

```dart
await $.native.tap(Selector(text: 'Sign up for newsletter'));
```

To open the notification shade:

```dart
await $.native.openNotifications();
```

To open the notification shade and tap on the first notfication:

```dart
await $.native.tapOnNotificationByIndex(1);
```

To handle the permission prompt:

```dart
await $.native.grantPermissionWhenInUse();
await $.native.grantPermissionOnlyThisTime();
await $.native.denyPermission();
```

If the shown permission prompt is the location prompt, you can also select the
accuracy:

```dart
await $.native.selectFineLocation();
await $.native.selectCoarseLocation();
```

Please note that the test will crash if the permission prompt is not visible.

app][example_app_tests].
