## Limitations

Maestro's feature of interacting with the native platform has a few limitations.

### iOS support

We've already got a basic PoC working on Simulator, but there's support for
physical devices yet.

One of our main goals over the coming weeks is to bring iOS support on par with
Android.

### Other platforms support

Supporting platforms other than Android and iOS is currently not a part of our
roadmap.

### Zones

Long story short, you can't use Flutter's `integration_test` if you're using a
package depending on Dart's zones, such as [hydrated_bloc][hydrated_bloc]. This
is a Flutter bug, but Maestro is affected by it because it depends on
`integration_test`.

For more info see [issue #96939 on flutter/flutter][zones_bug].
