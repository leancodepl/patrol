## Limitations

Maestro's feature of interacting with the native platform has a few limitations.

### iOS support

We've already got a basic PoC working on Simulator, but there's no support for
physical devices yet.

One of our main goals over the coming weeks is to bring iOS support on par with
Android.

### Other platforms support

Supporting platforms other than Android and iOS is currently not a part of our
roadmap.

### Zones

Long story short, you can't use Flutter's `integration_test` if you're using a
package depending on Dart's zones, such as [hydrated_bloc][hydrated_bloc]. This
is a Flutter bug, but Maestro is affected by it because it depends on
`integration_test`.

For more info see [issue #96939 on flutter/flutter][zones_bug].
