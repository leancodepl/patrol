## Limitations

Maestro's feature of interacting with the native platform has a few limitations.

### Feature parity across platforms

We strive for high feature parity across iOS and Android, but unfortunately it's
impossible to reach 100%.

Differences:

- Back button is not present on iOS

### Other platforms support

Supporting platforms other than iOS and Android is currently not a part of our
roadmap.

### Zones

Long story short, you can't use Flutter's `integration_test` if you're using
Dart's Zones. This is a Flutter bug, but Maestro is affected by it because it
depends on `integration_test`.
