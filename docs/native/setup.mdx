# Setup

Using Patrol's native automation feature requires more setup work than using
custom finders. Unfortunately it's necessary, because you have to integrate your
app with Android and/or iOS native testing tools.

We believe that the poweful features you'll get will make up for it!

1. Install `patrol` executable:

   ```bash
   $ dart pub global activate patrol_cli
   ```

2. Perform initial setup in your Flutter project root:

   ```bash
   $ patrol bootstrap
   ```

3. Run the example generated integration test:

   ```bash
   $ patrol drive
   ```
