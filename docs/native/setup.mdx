## Setup

Using Patrol's native capabilities requires more setup work than using custom
finders.

Worry not though, because there's `patrol bootstrap` command, which automates
everything that can be automated.

1. Install `patrol` executable:

   ```bash
   $ dart pub global activate patrol_cli
   ```

2. Perform initial setup in your Flutter project root:

   ```bash
   $ patrol bootstrap
   ```

3. Run the example generated integration test:
   ```bash
   $ patrol drive
   ```
