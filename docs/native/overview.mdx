## Overview

Flutter's [integration_test][integration_test] does a good job at providing
basic support for integration testing Flutter app. What it can't do is
interaction with the OS on which your Flutter app is running. This makes it
impossible to test so many critical business features:

- receiving and tapping on push notifications
- exiting the app, coming back, and verifying that state is preserved
- rotating the device
- enabling and disabling features such as Wi-Fi, mobile data, location, or dark
  mode

Maestro's native capabilities solve these problems.
