# Overview

Flutter's [integration_test][integration_test] does a good job at providing
basic support for integration testing Flutter apps. What it can't do is
interaction with the OS your Flutter app is running on. This makes it impossible
to test many critical business features:

- receiving and tapping on push notifications
- exiting the app, coming back, and verifying that state is preserved
- rotating the device
- enabling and disabling features such as Wi-Fi, mobile data, location, or dark
  mode
- granting runtime permissions

Patrol's native capabilities solve these problems.
