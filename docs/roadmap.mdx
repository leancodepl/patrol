# Roadmap

We want you to use Patrol, but we know

## Last release before 1.0

In this release, we'll deprecate the `patrol drive` command.

## 1.0

- In 1.0, we'll freeze the API, so that you can be confident your tests won't
  break because of a minor version bump.

- The `patrol drive` command will be removed in favor of `patrol test`.

## 2.0

In this version, we'll introduce a powerful Cypress-like running of tests.
