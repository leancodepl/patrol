# Roadmap

Patrol is still in beta, so we understand that not everyone might want to start
using it to test their production-grade apps. To reassure you, we're sharing our
plans for the upcoming months, so you can rest assured its development won't
suddently stop.

Besides the big milestones mentioned below, we're continuously answering your
questions, fixing bugs, and adding smaller tweaks, to make testing easier and
more fun.

## Last release before 1.0

In this release, we'll deprecate the `patrol drive` command.

### Why is `patrol drive` being deprecated?

`patrol drive` is named like that because under the hood, it executed the
`flutter drive` command (also known as [flutter_driver]). Depending on
`flutter_driver` initially seemed like a prudent choice, but as time went by, we
found many problems with it:

- `flutter_driver` isn't recommended anymore

  Flutter recommends using the `integration_test` package instead of
  `flutter_driver`, which doesn't get the same amount of support as `flutter
test`, and is somewhat deprecated. [A large number of flutter_driver issues have
  been unresolved for many years][flutter_driver_issues].

- `flutter_driver` is very flaky. When we first tried to use it on GitHub
  Actions, about 90% of `flutter drive` invocations were timing out. We've
  [contributed a fix][flutter_driver_fix] that made the situation better, but it
  still isn't reliable enough.

- The very way in which `flutter_driver` works is incompatible with device farm
  platforms such as Firebase Test Lab, and [compatibility with such platforms
  was the most-upvoted issue in Patrol's GitHub repository][testlab_issue]

### Why remove `patrol drive` instead of leaving it in addition to `patrol test`?

First of all, we want to minimize the number of choices our users have to make.
Using a new test framework alone is usually a tough decision, why add 2
similar-but-different commands that to accomplish the same?

This will also let focus on making `patrol test`, by freeing us from maintaining
2 ways of running tests.

## 1.0

In 1.0, we'll freeze the API, so that you'll confident your tests won't break
because of a minor version bump.

The `patrol drive` command will be removed in favor of `patrol test`.

## 2.0

In the longer run, we plan to enable easy, reliable hot-restarting of
integration tests to speed up the feedback loop and dramatically improve DX.

This feature might be accompanied by a test runner, which will be a separate
desktop Flutter app allowing you to easily rerun tests and view the results.
This feature draws much inspiration from the popular [Cypress] tool on the web
and the awesome [convenient_test] package.
