## Getting started

Let's say you want to find some `Text` widget – nothing easier than that!

```dart
find.byType(Text);
```

Using Patrol's custom finder, you'd write the above as:

```dart
$(Text);
```

Or let's find a `Text` widget with a specific text:

```dart
find.text('Subscribe');
```

Using Patrol's custom finder, you'd write the above as:

```dart
$('Subscribe');
```

Worth mentioning is also `Key`. The below lines are equivalent:

```dart
find.byKey(Key('loginButton'));
$(Key('loginButton'));
$(#loginButton);
```

For those wondering what is that `#` thing – it's a
[Symbol](https://api.dart.dev/dart-core/Symbol-class.html)! Yes, we're Dart
(ab)users.

All the types that you can pass to `$` are [listed in the
documentation][create_finder_docs].

### Performing actions

Finding widgets alone is cool, but what's even cooler is being able to tap on
them! Let's tap on the first 'Subscribe' text:

```dart
await tester.tap(find.text('Subscribe').first);
```

We have to use `first`, because if there were multiple "Subscribe" texts,
`tap()` would throw an exception.

With Patrol, you get concise code, but you preserve the flexibility:

```dart
await $('Subscribe').tap();
```

If you wanted to tap on the third "Subscribe" text, you'd do:

```dart
await $('Subscribe').at(2).tap();
```

### Going deeper

But hey, these were very simple examples. In real apps, unfortunately, finding
widgets is not that easy.

Often, you'll need to tap on a widget which is in some other widget.

```dart
await tester.tap(
  find.descendant(
    of: find.byType(ListView),
    matching: find.text('Subscribe'),
  ).first
);
```

Flutter's finders are starting to grow, while Patrol stays lean:

```dart
$(ListView).$('Subscribe').tap();
```

Now, we also make sure that the `Subscribe` text is in a `ListTile`:

```dart
await tester.tap(
  find.descendant(
    of: find.byType(ListView),
    matching: find.descendant(
      of: find.byType(ListTile),
      matching: find.text('Subscribe'),
      ),
    ),
  ).first
);
```

Hey, this is starting to look complex! Fortunately, you have Patrol:

```dart
await $(ListView).$(ListTile).$('Subscribe').tap();
```
