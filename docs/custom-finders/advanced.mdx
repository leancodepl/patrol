We aim to make Patrol as simple as possible, but there are still a few matters
that we feel require some more attention. We'll explain them in this section.

### How is Patrol's `tap()` different from Flutter `tap()`?

Let's consider this test, written without Patrol:

```dart
await tester.tap(find.byKey(Key('addComment')).first);
await tester.pumpAndSettle();
```

This code:

1. Immediately atttempts to find the first widget with `addComment` key
2. Immediately attempts to tap on it

This is the default behavior, but in our experience, it's often a source of
flakiness. For example, the widget having `addComment` key might not be visible
at the time when the finder is run. This usually doesn't means that the test
should fail. Probably an HTTP request was made to fetch the post, and when it is
fetched, the widget having `addComment` key will show up.

To achieve this behavior, you'd have to do:

```dart
while (find.byKey(Key('addComment')).first.evaluate().isEmpty) {
  await tester.pump(const Duration(milliseconds: 100));
}

await tester.tap(find.byKey(Key('addComment')).first);
await tester.pumpAndSettle();
```

Our tiny example got really big, but it's still got two problems.

1.  If something goes wrong and `addComment` never shows up, we'll keep waiting
    indefinitely.

2.  The widget with `addComment` key might be out of view. This means it's not
    possible to be tapped by a normal user, but our `tester` doesn't care. This
    is almost never desirable.

Fortunately, you don't have to overcome these problems. Patrol already did it!

Below is the same test, with all the problems fixed, written with Patrol's
custom finders:

```dart
await $(#addComment).tap();
```

This code:

1. Attempts to find the first widget with `addComment` that is visible on
   screen. If it's not found immediately, it keeps trying until it finds it, or
   throws an exception if timeout.
2. Taps on it.

The timeout can be configured globally:

```dart
patrolTest(
  'logs in successfully',
  config: PatrolTestConfig(findTimeout: Duration(seconds: 10)),
  ($) async {
  // your test code
  },
);
```

You can also change the timeout ad-hoc:

```dart
await $(#addComment).tap(findTimeout: Duration(seconds: 30));
```
