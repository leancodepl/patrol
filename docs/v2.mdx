# Patrol 2.0 is here!

Patrol 2.0 is the new major version of Patrol.

## Changes

- **Advanced test bundling** feature provides deep and seamless integration with
  existing Android and iOS testing tools. It also fixes some long-standing
  Flutter issues:

  - [#115751](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/115751)
  - [#101296](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/101296)
  - [#117386](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/117386)

  **This is huge** (even though it may not look like it at first glance). To
  learn more, read [the in-depth technical article][patrol_v2_article]
  explaining the nuts and bolts.

- **Improved scrolling and pumping** makes methods such as `tap()`,
  `enterText()`, and `scrollTo()` more reliable and easier to use. For example,
  they no longer throw an error if there's an infinite animation.

## Migration guide

Patrol 2.0 contains a few breaking changes.

Fortunately, they're small and mostly touch only boilerplate and configuration
files. The code of tests written in Dart stays the same (with some minor
exceptions - see the Caveats section below).

### Common

- Update the dependency in `pubspec.yaml`:

  ```yaml
  dev_dependencies:
    patrol: ^2.0.0
  ```

- Make sure you're using the newest version of Patrol CLI. It should begin with
  v2:

  ```console
  $ patrol --version
  patrol_cli v2.0.0
  ```

- The file `test_bundle.dart` in the `integration_test` directory should be
  added to gitignore. It's automatically generated by Patrol CLI at build time.

  ```text title=".gitignore"
  integration_test/test_bundle.dart
  ```

- In your tests, rename `scrollTo()`'s argument `scrollable` to `view`.

### Android

- **MainActivityTest.java**

  Contents of this file have to be replaced. It's located your application's
  **android/app/src/androidTest/java/com/example/myapp/** directory (replacing
  com, example, and myapp with values from your app's package name).

  ```java title="MainActivityTest.java"
  package pl.leancode.patrol.example; // replace "pl.leancode.patrol.example" with your app's package

  import androidx.test.platform.app.InstrumentationRegistry;
  import org.junit.Test;
  import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
  import org.junit.runners.Parameterized;
  import org.junit.runners.Parameterized.Parameters;
  import pl.leancode.patrol.PatrolJUnitRunner;

  @RunWith(Parameterized.class)
  public class MainActivityTest {
      @Parameters(name = "{0}")
      public static Object[] testCases() {
          PatrolJUnitRunner instrumentation = (PatrolJUnitRunner) InstrumentationRegistry.getInstrumentation();
          instrumentation.setUp(MainActivity.class);
          instrumentation.waitForPatrolAppService();
          return instrumentation.listDartTests();
      }

      public MainActivityTest(String dartTestName) {
          this.dartTestName = dartTestName;
      }

      private final String dartTestName;

      @Test
      public void runDartTest() {
          PatrolJUnitRunner instrumentation = (PatrolJUnitRunner) InstrumentationRegistry.getInstrumentation();
          instrumentation.runDartTest(dartTestName);
      }
  }
  ```

- **build.gradle**

  A few changes are also needed in **app-level build.gradle**:

  ```groovy title="android/app/build.gradle"
  android {
    // ...
    defaultConfig {
      //...
      testInstrumentationRunner "pl.leancode.patrol.PatrolJUnitRunner"
    }

    // ...

    testOptions {
      execution "ANDROIDX_TEST_ORCHESTRATOR"
    }
  }

  dependencies {
    androidTestUtil "androidx.test:orchestrator:1.4.2"
  }
  ```

  <Info>
    To achieve full isolation between test runs, enable the `clearPackageData` option:

    ```groovy title="android/app/build.gradle"
    defaultConfig {
      //...
      testInstrumentationRunner "pl.leancode.patrol.PatrolJUnitRunner"
      testInstrumentationRunnerArguments clearPackageData: "true"
    }
    ```

    This will clear the app's data and permissions before each test run.
    Unfortunately, no equivalent feature is available on iOS.
  </Info>

  If you had `testImplementation "junit:junit:4.13.2"` (or similar) in
  `dependencies` block, it should be removed.

### iOS

On iOS, only one line has to be added in the `RunnerUITests.m` file. Simply copy
and paste these contents:

```objective-c title="ios/RunnerUITests/RunnerUITests.m"
@import XCTest;
@import patrol;
@import ObjectiveC.runtime;

PATROL_INTEGRATION_TEST_IOS_RUNNER(RunnerUITests)
```

That's all!

## Caveats

There are a few, and all are kept track of in [this issue]. We intent to fix all
of them in future releases.
