# Compatibility table

The following table describes which versions of `patrol`
and `patrol_cli` are compatible with each other.
The simplest way to ensure that both packages are compatible
is by always using the latest version. However,
if for some reason that isn't possible, you can refer to 
the table below to assess which version you should use.

|     patrol     |   patrol_cli   |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| 3.6.0 -        | 2.6.5 -        |
| 3.4.0 - 3.5.2  | 2.6.0 - 2.6.4  |
| 3.0.0 - 3.3.0  | 2.3.0 - 2.5.0  |
| 2.3.0 - 2.3.2  | 2.2.0 - 2.2.2  |
| 2.0.1 - 2.2.5  | 2.0.1 - 2.1.5  |
| 2.0.0          | 2.0.0          |
