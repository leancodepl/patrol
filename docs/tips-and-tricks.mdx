## Tips and tricks

## Running a test many times

Sometimes, you might want to run a test many times. In such case, we've got
these one-liners for you:

**Bash**

```bash
$ for i in {1..10}; do patrol drive --target integration_test/my_test.dart; done
```

**PowerShell**

```powershell
1..10 | ForEach-Object { patrol drive --target integration_test/my_test.dart }
```

## Inspecting native view hierarchy

It's hard to tap on or enter text into a view you don't know how to refer to. In
such situation we recommmend doing a native view hierarchy dump and finding the
properties of the view you want to act on.

**Android**

First, perform a native view hierarchy dump using `adb`:

```bash
$ adb shell uiautomator dump
```

Then, copy the dump file from the device to your machine:

```bash
$ adb pull /sdcard/window_dump.xml .
```

**iOS**

The easiest way to perform the native view hierarchy dumb on iOS is to use the
[idb] tool.

Once you have [idb] installed, perform a dump:

```bash
$ idb ui describe-all
```

## Avoiding hardcoding credentials in tests

It's a bad practice to hardcode data such as emails, usernames, and passwords in
test code.

```dart
await $(#nameTextField).enterText('Bartek'); // bad!
await $(#passwordTextField).enterText('ny4ncat'); // bad as well!
```

To fix this, we recommend removing the hardcoded credentials from test code and
providing them through the environment:

```dart
await $(#nameTextField).enterText(String.fromEnvironment('USERNAME'));
await $(#passwordTextField).enterText(String.fromEnvironment('PASSWORD'));
```

To set `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`, use `--dart-define`:

```bash
$ patrol drive --dart-define 'USERNAME=Bartek' --dart-define 'PASSWORD=ny4ncat'
```

## Granting sensitive permission through the Settings app

Some particularly sensitive permissions (such as access to background location
or controlling the Do Not Disturb feature) cannot be requested in the permission
dialog like most of the common permissions. Instead, you have to ask the user to
go to the Settings app and grant your app the permission you need.

Testing such flows is not as simple as simply granting normal permission, but
it's totally possible with Patrol.

Below we present you with a snippet that will make the built-in Camera app have
access to the Do Not Disturb feature on Android. Let's assume that the Settings
app on the device we want to run the tests on looks like this:

And here's the code:

```dart
await $.native.tap(Selector(text: 'Camera')); // tap on the list tile
await $.native.tap(Selector(text: 'ALLOW')); // handle the confirmation dialog
await $.native.pressBack(); // go back to the app under test
```

Please note that the UI of the Settings app differs across operating systems,
their versions, and OEM flavors (in case of Android). You'll have to handle all
edge cases yourself.
