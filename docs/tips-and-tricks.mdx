## Tips and tricks

## Running a test many times

Sometimes, you might want to run a test many times. In such case, we've got
these one-liners for you:

**Bash**

```bash
for i in {1..10}; do patrol drive --target integration_test/my_test.dart; done
```

**PowerShell**

```powershell
1..10 | ForEach-Object { patrol drive --target integration_test/my_test.dart }
```

## Inspecting native view hierarchy

It's hard to tap on or enter text into something you don't know how to refer to.
It's heplful to do a native view hierarchy dump and find the properties of the
view you want to act on.

### Android

```bash
adb shell uiautomator dump
```

Then, copy the dump file from the device to your machine:

```bash
adb pull /sdcard/window_dump.xml .
```

### iOS

```bash
idb ui describe-all
```
