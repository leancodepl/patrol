# drive

### Synopsis

Runs tests on devices.

```bash
$ patrol drive
```

To learn more about this command, run `patrol drive --help`.

### Description

This command is the one use you'll be using most often.

It does all the low-level things required to enable interacting with native OS,
such as tapping on permission dialgos, notifications, and controlling Wi-Fi.

### Discussion

By default, `patrol drive` runs all integration tests (files ending with
`_test.dart` located in the `integration_test` directory).

To run a single test, use `--target`:

```bash
$ patrol drive --target integration_test/login_test.dart
```

You can use `--target` more than once to run multiple tests:

```bash
$ patrol drive \
    --target integration_test/login_test.dart \
    --target integration_test/change_profile_picture_test.dart
```

Test files must end with `_test.dart`. Otherwise the file is not considered a
test and is not run.

There's no difference between `--target` and `--targets`.
