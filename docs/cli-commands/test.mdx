# test

### Synopsis

Runs Flutter integration tests as native tests on devices.

```
patrol test
```

To learn more about this command, run `patrol test --help`.

### Description

This command is the one use you'll be using most often.

`patrol test` does the following things:

1. Builds the app under test (AUT) and the instrumentation app
2. Installs the AUT and the instrumentation on the selected device
3. Runs the tests natively, and reports results back in native format. 4.

Under the hood, it calls Gradle (when testing on Android) and `xcodebuild` (when
testing on iOS).

### Discussion

By default, `patrol test` runs all integration tests (files ending with
`_test.dart` located in the `integration_test` directory).

To run a single test, use `--target`:

```
patrol test --target integration_test/login_test.dart
```

You can use `--target` more than once to run multiple tests:

```
patrol test \
  --target integration_test/login_test.dart \
  --target integration_test/app_test.dart
```

Or alternatively:

```
patrol test --targets integration_test/login_test.dart,integration_test/app_test.dart
```

Test files must end with `_test.dart`. Otherwise the file is not considered a
test and is not run.

<Info>There's no difference between `--target` and `--targets`.</Info>
