title: Commands - test

### Synopsis

Run integration tests.

```
patrol test
```

To see all available options and flags, run `patrol test --help`.

### Description

This command is the one use you'll be using most often.

`patrol test` does the following things:

1. Builds the app under test (AUT) and the instrumentation app
2. Installs the AUT and the instrumentation on the selected device
3. Runs the tests natively, and reports results back in native format.

Under the hood, it calls Gradle (when testing on Android) and `xcodebuild` (when
testing on iOS).

### Discussion

By default, `patrol test` runs all integration tests (files ending with
`_test.dart` located in the `integration_test` directory).

To run a single test, use `--target`:

```
patrol test --target integration_test/login_test.dart
```

You can use `--target` more than once to run multiple tests:

```
patrol test \
  --target integration_test/login_test.dart \
  --target integration_test/app_test.dart
```

Or alternatively:

```
patrol test --targets integration_test/login_test.dart,integration_test/app_test.dart
```

Test files must end with `_test.dart`. Otherwise the file is not considered a
test and is not run.

<Info>There's no difference between `--target` and `--targets`.</Info>

To delay app uninstallation for 5 seconds after the test finishes:

```
patrol test --target integration_test/app_test.dart --wait 5
```

#### Tags

You can use tags to run only tests with specific tags. 

First specify tags in your patrol tests:

```dart
  patrol(
    'example test with tag',
    tags: ['android'],
    ($) async {
      await createApp($);

      await $(FloatingActionButton).tap();
      expect($(#counterText).text, '1');
    },
  );

  patrol(
    'example test with two tags',
    tags: ['android', 'ios'],
    ($) async {
      await createApp($);

      await $(FloatingActionButton).tap();
      expect($(#counterText).text, '1');
    },
  );
```

Then you can run tests with the tags you specified:

```bash
patrol test --tags android
patrol test --tags=android
patrol test --tags='android||ios'
patrol test --tags='(android || ios)'
patrol test --tags='(android && tablet)'
```

You can also use `--exclude-tags` to exclude tests with specific tags:

```bash
patrol test --exclude-tags android
patrol test --exclude-tags='(android||ios)'
```

#### Coverage

<Warning>
        Coverage collection is currently not supported on macOS.
</Warning>

To collect coverage from patrol tests, use `--coverage`.

```
patrol test --coverage
```

The LCOV report will be saved to `/coverage/patrol_lcov.info`.

Additionally, you can exclude certain files from the report using glob patterns and `--coverage-ignore` option. For instance,

```
patrol test --coverage --coverage-ignore="**/*.g.dart"
```

excludes all files ending with `.g.dart`.

### Under the hood

`patrol test` basically calls `patrol build` and then runs the built app
binaries. For more info, read [docs of `patrol build`][patrol_build].
