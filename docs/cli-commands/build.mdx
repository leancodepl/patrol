# build

### Synopsis

Build app binaries for integration testing.

```
patrol build android
patrol build ios
```

To see all available options and flags, run `patrol build android --help` or
`patrol build ios --help`.

<Info>
  For `patrol build` to work, you must complete [native setup](/native/setup).
</Info>

### Description

`patrol build` is useful if you want to run test on CI, for example on Firebase
Test Lab. It works the same as `patrol test`, except that it does run tests.

`patrol build` builds apps in debug mode by default.

<Info>
  To run tests on a physical iOS device on a device farm, the apps have to be
  built in release mode. To do so, pass the `--release` flag.
</Info>

### Examples

**To build a single test for Android in debug mode**

```
patrol build android --target integration_test/example_test.dart
```

or alternatively (but redundantly):

```
patrol build android --target integration_test/example_test.dart --debug
```

**To build all tests for Android in debug mode**

```
patrol build android
```

**To build a single test for iOS device in release mode**

```
patrol build ios --target integration_test/example_test.dart --release
```

**To build a single test for iOS simulator in debug mode**

```
patrol build ios --target integration_test/example_test.dart --debug
```

### Under the hood

The `patrol build` command walks through hierarchy of the `integration_test`
directory and finds all files that end with `_test.dart`, and then creates an
additional "test bundle" file that references all the tests it found. Thanks to
this, all tests are built into a single app binary - only a single build is
required. If you're curious to learn more about this problem, see [Flutter issue
