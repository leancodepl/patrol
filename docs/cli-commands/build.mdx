# build

### Synopsis

Build app binaries for integration testing.

```
patrol build android
patrol build ios
```

To see all available options and flags, run `patrol build android --help` or
`patrol build ios --help`.

<Info>
  For `patrol build` to work, you must complete [native setup](/native/setup).
</Info>

### Description

`patrol build` is useful if you want to run test on CI, for example on Firebase
Test Lab. It works the same as `patrol test`, except that it does run tests.

`patrol build` builds apps in debug mode by default.

<Info>
  To run tests on a physical iOS device on a device farm, the apps have to be
  built in release mode. To do so, pass the `--release` flag.
</Info>

### Examples

**To build for Android in debug mode**

```
patrol build android --target integration_test/example_test.dart
```

or alternatively (but redundantly):

```
patrol build android --target integration_test/example_test.dart --debug
```

**To build for iOS device in release mode**

```
patrol build ios --target integration_test/example_test.dart --release
```

**To build for iOS simulator in debug mode**

```
patrol build ios --target integration_test/example_test.dart --debug
```

### Caveats

Only a single test target file can be built. For example, consider the following
`integration_test` directory containing 4 test targets:

```
integration_test/
├── common.dart
├── example_test.dart
├── notifications_test.dart
├── permissions_location_test.dart
├── webview_login_test.dart
```

<Info>Dart file must end with `_test.dart` to be considered to be a test.</Info>

To build the app for testing on Android, you have to run:

```
patrol build android --target <your file>
```

4 times, each time with a different `--target`, to get 4 different app binaries.

These 4 different binaries are almost the same – the only difference is the
entrypoint. This is needlessly inefficient for apps with many tests, but it's a
design flaw in the way integration testing in Flutter works.

[We know about this issue][bundling_issue] and we're aiming to fix it soon with
an approach we call "test bundling". This will dramatically speed up testing
apps with many integration tests.
