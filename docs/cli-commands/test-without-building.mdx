title: Commands - test-without-building
---

### Synopsis

Run integration tests without building the app.

```bash
patrol test-without-building
```

To see all available options and flags, run `patrol test-without-building --help`.

### Description

This command executes Patrol tests without performing the application build process.
It is designed for scenarios where you need to efficiently re-run tests using an existing build,
thereby significantly reducing test execution time. The command supports all options available in patrol test,
including build mode, flavor and device.

<Warning>
    This command requires a valid build to exist in the build directory.
    `patrol test-without-building` executes all available tests, and the test application must be built for
    all test cases. The application must be built using the same entrypoint file (`test_bundle.dart`).
    You also have to run `patrol test-without-building` command with the same build mode, flavor and port options.
</Warning>

### Prerequisites

Before using `patrol test-without-building`, ensure that:

1. **Existing build**: A valid build must already exist in your project's build directory
2. **Complete test build**: The build includes all test cases intended for execution - if new tests have been added
since the last build, a new build must be created first
3. **Source code consistency**: The build must correspond to the current state of your source code - any modifications
to test files or application code since the build was created may result in unexpected behavior or test failures

### Under the hood

- Test results and reporting functionality are identical to those provided by `patrol test`
- The app installation and test execution processes follow the same procedures as `patrol test`

### Creating the required build

To create a build that can be used with `test-without-building`, use:

```bash
patrol build android  # for Android
patrol build ios      # for iOS
patrol build macos    # for macOS
```

Or simply run `patrol test` once, which will create the build and then run tests.

<Info>
    **Important Note:** `patrol test` or `patrol build` must be run without additional target, exclude or tags flags.
