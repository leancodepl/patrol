# bootstrap

### Synopsis

Bootstraps the Flutter project to use Patrol.

```
patrol bootstrap
```

To learn more about this command, run `patrol bootstrap --help`.

### Description

To use Patrol's native features, you need to set it up first. This command
automates this setup.

Bootstrap does the following:

1. Adds `package:patrol` as a dev_dependency in `pubspec.yaml`
1. Adds `package:integration_test` as a dev_dependency in `pubspec.yaml`
1. Creates default `test_driver/integration_test.dart`
1. Creates default `integration_test/app_test.dart`

After `patrol bootstrap`, you should be able to `patrol drive` and an example
app should show up on your device.
