## bootstrap

To use Patrol's native features, you need to set it up first. This command
automates this setup.

Bootstrap does the following:

1. Creates default `patrol.toml`
2. Adds `package:patrol` as a dev_dependency in `pubspec.yaml`
3. Adds `package:integration_test` as a dev_dependency in `pubspec.yaml`
4. Creates default `test_driver/integration_test.dart`
5. Creates default `integration_test/app_test.dart`

After `patrol bootstrap`, you should be able to `patrol drive` and an example
app should show up on your device.
