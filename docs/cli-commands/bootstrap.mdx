## bootstrap

To use Maestro's native features, you need to set it up first. Worry not though,
because `maestro bootstrap` is here to help.

Bootstrap does the following:

1. Creates default `maestro.toml`
2. Adds `package:maestro_test` as a dev_dependency in `pubspec.yaml`
3. Adds `package:integration_test` as a dev_dependency in `pubspec.yaml`
4. Creates default `test_driver/integration_test.dart`
5. Creates default `integration_test/app_test.dart`

After `maestro bootstrap`, you should be able to `maestro drive` and an example
app should show up ono your device.
