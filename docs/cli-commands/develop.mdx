# develop

### Synopsis

Develop integration tests as native tests on devices.

```
patrol develop
```

To learn more about this command, run `patrol develop --help`.

### Description

`patrol develop` makes the development of integration tests faster and more fun,
thanks to Flutter's Hot Restart feature.



The Dart VM starts the entrypoint again.

Only the "Dart side" of your app is restarted.
