# develop

### Synopsis

Develop integration tests with Hot Restart.

```
patrol develop
```

To see all available options and flags, run `patrol develop --help`.

### Description

`patrol develop` makes the development of integration tests faster and more fun,
thanks to Flutter's Hot Restart feature.

To run a test file with Hot Restart, specify the `--target` option:

```
patrol develop --target integration_test/example_test.dart
```

This performs a build of your app, so it's usually slow.

When the build completes and the app starts, Hot Restart becomes active after a
short while. Once it is active, type **R** to trigger a Hot Restart.

### Caveats

`patrol develop` is powerful, but it has some limitations. It's important to
understand them to write correct tests.

Flutter apps consist of 2 parts: the native part and the Flutter part. **Hot
Restart restarts only the Flutter part of your app**.

When you press **R**, the Flutter part of your app is restarted â€“ your `main()`
function is run again.

It's important to note that:

- The native part of your app is not restarted
- The app's data is not cleared
- The app is not uninstalled

Below are a few common scenarios when state of your app will probably differ
between the first and later Hot Restarts.

**No support for physical iOS**

Patrol's Hot Restart is very unreliable when running on physical iOS devices, to
the point that we consider it completely broken. This is unfortunate, but it's a
[bug on the Flutter's side](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/122698).

**Permissions**

Once granted, a permissions cannot be revoked.

You have to work around this by handling both cases (of granted and not granted
permissions) in your tests.

Removing all permissions at the beginning of each test won't work - both iOS and
Android kill the app when any permission is revoked, and when the app dies, Hot
Restart stops.

**File system**

The files your app creates in its internal storage aren't cleared between hot
restarts.

For example, when some data is saved to SharedPreferences during the first
restart, it will stay around in subsequent restarts (unless it's manually
cleared).

The same goes for any data the app creates during test - photos, documents, etc.
It's your responsibility to clean them up at the right time to have a stable
environment during `patrol develop`.

**Native state**

If your app has some native code that runs only when the app is first run, it
won't be re-executed on hot restarts.

These cases are quite specific and it's hard to give advice without knowing the
context.
