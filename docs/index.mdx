# About

![Patrol promotial graphics][promo_graphics]

Patrol is a new testing framework for Flutter. It builds on top of Flutter's
testing tools to let you do things which were previously impossible.

Patrol lets you [access features of the platform][native] that the Flutter app
is running on. For example, you can go to the home screen, tap on notifications,
change device settings, or toggle Wi-Fi – and you can code this very easily in
Dart.

Patrol also provides a [new custom finder system][finders] that extends
Flutter's default finders. Patrol's custom finders, coupled with [Hot Restart],
make writing widget tests and integration tests _dramatically_ faster, easier,
and more fun!

Patrol is an open-source project which is being developed and maintained by us –
[LeanCode][leancode]! We use it to test our clients' production-grade apps, and
you can do the same!
