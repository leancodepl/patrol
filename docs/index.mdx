# About

Maestro is a new testing framework for Flutter. It builds on top of Flutter's
testing tools to let you do things which were previously impossible.

Maestro lets you [access features of the platform][native] that the Flutter app
is running on. For example, you can go to the home screen, rotate the device,
and then go back – and you can code this very easily in Dart.

Maestro also provides a [new custom finder system][custom-finders] that extends
Flutter's default finders. Maestro's custom finders make writing Flutter widget
tests _dramatically_ faster, easier, and more fun!

Maestro is an open-source project which is being developed and maintained by us
– [LeanCode][leancode]! It is still in active development and hasn't reached 1.0
yet, but we already use it to test production apps.
