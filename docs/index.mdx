## About

Maestro is a testing framework for Flutter. It builds on top of Flutter's
testing tools to provide let you do things which were previously impossible in
Flutter tests.

Maestro lets you access features of the platform that the Flutter app is running
on. For example, you can go to the home screen, rotate the device, and then go
back â€“ and you can code this very easily in Dart.

Maestro also provides a new custom finder system that extends Flutter's default
finders. Maestro's custom finders make writing Flutter widget tests
_dramatically_ faster, easier, and more fun!

Maestro is still in active development.
