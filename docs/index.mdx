## About

Maestro is a new testing framework for Flutter. It builds on top of Flutter's
testing tools to let you do things which were previously impossible.

Maestro lets you access features of the platform that the Flutter app is running
on. For example, you can go to the home screen, rotate the device, and then go
back – and you can code this very easily in Dart.

Maestro also provides a new custom finder system that extends Flutter's default
finders. Maestro's custom finders make writing Flutter widget tests
_dramatically_ faster, easier, and more fun!

Maestro is an open-source project which is being developed and maintained by us
– [LeanCode][leancode]! We already use it to test production apps.

Maestro is still in active development and hasn't reached 1.0 yet.

## How is it different from `package:integration_test`?

Maestro builds on top of [package:integration_test][package_integration_test].
This means that you can do everything that package:integration_test can do, plus
some additional, awesome things.

## How is it different from Appium?

Appium is one of the most the most popular tool for automating mobile app
testing. It has a big community and there are lots of resources on the internet
on it. Unfortunately, we found that Appium doesn't fit well into Flutter world.
Actually, the idea for Maestro was born out of our frustration with trying to
use Appium for testing Flutter apps.

1. Appium does not feel native to Flutter. To use it, you need `Node.js`, and
   you need to use `npm`. You used 1 language in your app (Dart), and now you
   got the second one. It's setup is cumbersome.

1. Maestro lets you do [greybox testing][greybox], while Appium lets you do
   [blackbox testing][blackbox].

1. Appium is much more mature than Maestro.

TODO: Make sure that the above is correct. One can write Appium client in Dart.
TODO: bash appium more with some better arguments
