# Patrol by LeanCode

![Patrol promotial graphics][promo_graphics]

Patrol is a powerful, open-source testing framework for Flutter apps created and
maintained by [LeanCode] – one of the leading Flutter development consultancies
in the world. Patrol builds on top of Flutter's existing test tooling to enable
you to do things which were previously impossible.

It lets you [access native features of the platform][native] that the
Flutter app is running on. Finally, you can interact with permission dialogs,
notifications, WebViews, change device settings, toggle Wi-Fi, and much more –
and you can code this very easily in plain Dart.

Patrol also provides a [new custom finder system][finders] that extends
Flutter's default finders, making them shorter and easier to understand.
Patrol's custom finders, coupled with [Hot Restart], make writing integration
tests _dramatically_ faster, easier and more fun!

Patrol is also a revamped, production-quality version of Flutter's built-in
`integration_test` plugin. It fixes its shortcomings and enables features such
as full isolation between tests and sharding.

Patrol is a fully open-source project and we're proud to share it with the
awesome Flutter community.

At LeanCode, we use Patrol to test our clients' production-grade apps, and you
can do the same!
