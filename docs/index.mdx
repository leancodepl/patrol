# About

![Patrol promotial graphics][promo_graphics]

Patrol is a new testing framework for Flutter. It builds on top of Flutter's
existing test tooling to let you do things which were previously impossible.

Patrol lets you [access native features of the platform][native] that the
Flutter app is running on. Finally, you can interact with permission dialogs,
notifications, WebViews, change device settings, toggle Wi-Fi, and much more –
and you can code this very easily in plain Dart.

Patrol also provides a [new custom finder system][finders] that extends
Flutter's default finders, making them shorter and easier to understand.
Patrol's custom finders, coupled with [Hot Restart], make writing widget tests
and integration tests _dramatically_ faster, easier, and more fun!

Patrol is also a revamped, production-quality version of Flutter's built-in
`integration_test` plugin. It fixes its shortcomings and enables features such
as full isolation between tests and sharding.

Patrol is an open-source project which is being developed and maintained by us –
[LeanCode][leancode]! We use it to test our clients' production-grade apps, and
you can do the same!
