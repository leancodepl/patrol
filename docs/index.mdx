# About Patrol framework

![Patrol promotial graphics][promo_graphics]

Patrol is a new testing framework for Flutter. It builds on top of Flutter's
existing test tooling to let you do things which were previously impossible.

Patrol is combined of 3 packages - one dedicated to widget testing, and other
two made for UI testing. Together they provide enhanced testing experience
both for developers and for automating testers.

### patrol
`patrol` package lets you [access native features of the platform][native] that the
Flutter app is running on. Finally, you can interact with permission dialogs,
notifications, WebViews, change device settings, toggle Wi-Fi, and much more –
and you can code this very easily in plain Dart.

### patrol_finders
`patrol_finders` package provides a [new custom finder system][finders] that extends
Flutter's default finders, making them shorter and easier to understand. They can be
used in all kinds of Flutter tests, and in Patrol-specific UI tests.

### patrol_cli
`patrol_cli` package has dedicated commands for running UI tests. It also contains
[Hot Restart] feature, which makes writing integration tests _dramatically_ faster,
easier, and more fun!

Patrol is an open-source project which is being developed and maintained by us –
[LeanCode][leancode]! We use it to test our clients' production-grade apps, and
you can do the same!
