## 3.0.1

- Fix extension code not being bundled by GitHub Actions workflow (#1902)

## 3.0.0

Give a warm welcome to the new **Patrol DevTools Extension**!

Patrol DevTools extension allows you to explore the native view hierarchy when
developing tests with `patrol develop`. Now you can easily see what Android /
iOS views are currently visible and discover their properties so that they can
be used in native selectors like `$.native.tap()`. You donâ€™t have to use any
external tools for that. This is just the beginning, and we plan to add more
features to our extension in the future.
