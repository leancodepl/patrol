Command-line tool to make working with [patrol][pub_link_test] easier.

## Installation

### From pub.dev

```console
$ dart pub global activate patrol_cli
```

### From git

1. Make sure that you have Dart >= 2.18 installed.

   ```console
   $ dart --version
   ```

2. Clone the repo.
3. Go to `packages/patrol_cli`.
4. Run `dart pub global activate --source path .`

### Troubleshooting

If you can't run `patrol` from the terminal and the error is something along the
lines of "command not found", make sure that you've added appropriate
directories to PATH:

- on Unix-like systems, add `$HOME/.pub-cache/bin`
- on Windows, add `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Pub\Cache\bin`

### Shell completion

Patrol CLI supports shell completion for bash, zsh and fish, thanks to the
[cli_completion package]. It will automatically append code necessary to make
the completion work to your shell's respective config file (e.g. `~/.zshrc`). To
disable this value, set the `PATROL_NO_COMPLETION` environment variable to any
value.
