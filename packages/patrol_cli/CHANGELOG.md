- Make `patrol develop` command visible (#1104)

## 1.1.0

- Add `patrol develop` command which supports **Hot Restart** (#1057). It's not
  stable, but you can already try it out and report bugs.

## 1.0.5

- Add `patrol build` command to make it easier to build app binaries for cloud
  device farms (#1006). It's not stable, but you can already try it out and
  report bugs. Also, for now it only builds Android APKs.

## 1.0.4

- Make it possible to run x86-only iOS apps on the Simulator (#1005)
- Make it possible to define flavor per OS in `patrol` in `pubspec.yaml`

## 0.9.4

- `patrol test`: Improve how external tool invocations are logged when running

  flag) to the Flutter side (#892)

## 0.9.2

- Fix `patrol test` broken on Windows when running tests on Android (#889)

## 0.9.1

- Improve error message of `patrol test` when the `integration_test` directory
  doesn't exist (#876)
- Make `patrol test` run tests in a more predictable, `ls`-like order (#882)
- Fix `patrol test` incorrectly encoding `--dart-define` when running on Android
  (#885)
- Display name of currently running test file in top-left corner (#885)

## 0.9.0

- Enable `patrol test` for physical iOS devices (#863)
- Make it possible to specify `package_name` and `bundle_id` in `pubspec.yaml`
  (#868)

  If these values are set, the tool automatically uninstalls the app after every
  test. It's recommended to set them.

  Example:

  ```yaml
  dependencies:
    # ...

  dev_dependencies:
    # ...

  patrol:
    android:
      package_name: pl.leancode.awesomeapp
      app_name: Awesome App
    ios:
      bundle_id: pl.leancode.AwesomeApp
      app_name: Awesome App
  ```

## 0.8.6

- Uninstall app under test after `patrol test` (#848)

  This currently requires package name (on Android) and bundle identifier (on
  iOS) to be passed through respective arguments to `patrol test`. Soon it'll
  also be possible to define these values in `pubspec.yaml.

- Print helpful links when called without arguments (#865)
- Fix verbose output from Gradle having garbled newlines (#858)

## 0.8.5

- Add a deprecation warning to `patrol drive` command (#833)

  Use the new `patrol test` command. [See setup
  instructions](https://patrol.leancode.co/native/setup).

## 0.8.4

- When using `patrol test`, infer `--configuration` from `--flavor` when
  possible (#796)

- Fix `patrol test` on Windows (#805)

## 0.8.3

- Make `patrol test` more configurable (#791)

## 0.8.2+1

- Fix typo in changelog (#783)

## 0.8.2

- Add `patrol test` command (#731)

  `patrol test` runs tests natively (using Gradle on Android and `xcodebuild` on
  iOS). This command is hidden from `patrol --help` for now until we're sure it
  has the same features `patrol drive`, but you can already use it. In a future
  release, `patrol drive` will be deprecated, and in 1.0, `patrol drive` will be
  removed in favor of `patrol test`.

  [Learn more
  here](https://patrol.leancode.co/roadmap#why-is-patrol-drive-being-deprecated)
