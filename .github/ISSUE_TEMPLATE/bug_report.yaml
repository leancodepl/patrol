        Create a [minimal, reproducible example] that:

        1. Demonstrates the problem
        2. Explains how to reproduce the problem with the detailed step-by-step
        instructions

        In addition to the detailed step-by-step instructions, you must include
        the device you're encountering the issue on (e.g. physical Android, iOS
        Simulator), and the OS version (e.g. Android 9, iOS 14).

        Aside from the mandatory information, include as much additional details
        as possible to make it easier for us to understand and fix the problem.
        Screenshots and videos are welcome.

        **Issues that cannot be reproduced will be closed.**

        Include the full logs of the command you're running between the lines
        with the backticks below. Run the command with the `--verbose` flag.

        If you're running more than single command, include its logs in a
        separate backticks block.

        If the logs are too large to be uploaded to Github, you may upload
        them as a `txt` file or use online tools like https://pastebin.com to
        share it.

        **Do not upload screenshots of text**. Instead, use code blocks or the
        above mentioned ways to upload logs.

        **Make sure the logs are well formatted**. If you post garbled logs, we
        won't be able to help you and the issue will be closed.
